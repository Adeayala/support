Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary: File Content Access Issues\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User experiences an issue where Pieces does not recognize file content without manual copy-pasting into the chat, even though it recognizes file names.\n* User clarifies:\n    * Long-term memory is enabled.\n    * Both Claude and gpt foundation models exhibit the issue.\n    * Issue occurs with all folders and files, including test files.\n    * User uses Windows 11 Home, 24H2.\n    * User works with 4 files, 3 of which have thousands of lines of code.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Pieces cannot read content of large files directly, causing inconvenience for users.\n* Difficulty reproducing the issue by developers.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Developer requests specific information and proposes call for further investigation.\n* Developer suggests additional troubleshooting steps.\n* Developer proposes alternative call with another team member.\n* Developer mentions potential recent changes that may resolve the issue.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue's cause and resolution remain unclear.\n* User scheduled a call with a different developer to further troubleshoot.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* User expressed appreciation for developer's responsiveness and willingness to resolve the issue.",

Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary: File Content Access Issues\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User experiences an issue where Pieces does not recognize file content without manual copy-pasting into the chat, even though it recognizes file names.\n* User clarifies:\n    * Long-term memory is enabled.\n    * Both Claude and gpt foundation models exhibit the issue.\n    * Issue occurs with all folders and files, including test files.\n    * User uses Windows 11 Home, 24H2.\n    * User works with 4 files, 3 of which have thousands of lines of code.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Pieces cannot read content of large files directly, causing inconvenience for users.\n* Difficulty reproducing the issue by developers.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Developer requests specific information and proposes call for further investigation.\n* Developer suggests additional troubleshooting steps.\n* Developer proposes alternative call with another team member.\n* Developer mentions potential recent changes that may resolve the issue.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue's cause and resolution remain unclear.\n* User scheduled a call with a different developer to further troubleshoot.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* User expressed appreciation for developer's responsiveness and willingness to resolve the issue.",
