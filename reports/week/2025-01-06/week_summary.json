Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User (RamanBaig) reported an issue where Pieces could recognize files and their names but could not read their content unless it was copied and pasted into the chat.\n* This issue was particularly troublesome for large files with thousands of lines of code.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The long term memory feature seemed to be a factor.\n* The issue persisted across all file types and folders.\n* The issue occurred on Windows 11 and with both Claude and GPT models.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Sam, a Pieces team member, asked for more details to reproduce the issue and tried to identify potential fixes.\n* They offered to schedule a call with the user for further troubleshooting.\n* Mark, another Pieces team member, offered their own calendar availability for a call. \n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The root cause of the problem remains unidentified. \n* A potential solution was implemented, but its effectiveness is yet to be confirmed.\n* A call between the user and either Sam or Mark is scheduled to investigate further.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The specific version of Windows 11 used by the user is Windows 11 Home, 24H2.\n* The affected folder contained approximately 9 files, with 4 of them being actively used and containing thousands of lines of code.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Conduct the scheduled call between the user and Pieces team members for further troubleshooting.\n* Verify if the implemented solution resolves the issue. \n\nI hope this summary is helpful!",

This issue persisted even when opening a project or not.\n\n**Troubleshooting and Diagnosis:**\n\n* Initial troubleshooting advice by the Pieces Support Bot included reviewing related issues and documentation.\n* @robert-at-pieces identified documentation inconsistencies regarding port changes in newer versions of Pieces OS. \n* User confirmed the port number and tried connecting, but without success.\n* It was confirmed that the VSCode remote instance was hosted inside Docker.\n* Further testing revealed issues arising specifically when opening remote projects within the container.\n\n**Cause:** Networking changes in Pieces OS 11.0.0 restricted server listening to the loopback interface by default, causing a disconnect between the remote container and Pieces OS.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nA patch was planned to allow Pieces Server to listen on all interfaces again.\nA complex workaround involving DNS configuration was offered as a temporary solution until the patch was deployed.\n\n**Patch Deployment:**\n\nThe VSCode extension was updated to version 2.0.1, incorporating the necessary patch. Users were instructed to update the plugin and try connecting with a blank custom URL.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe user confirmed updating the plugin but reported the issue persisted. A video call was suggested for deeper debugging.\n\n\n## Key Points:\n\n* The user experienced a connection issue between a Docker container and Pieces OS.\n* The problem originated from network restrictions in the latest Pieces OS version.\n* A patch addressing the problem was deployed in VSCode extension version 2.0.1.\n* The user still faced connectivity issues after installing the patch and further assistance through a video call was offered.\n\n## Current Status:\n\nWhile the patch addressed the root cause, the user continues to experience connection errors. A scheduled video call aims to delve deeper into the issue and find a definitive resolution.",
