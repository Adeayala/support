While the Discord team has confirmed that this feature should be available on Linux, the Pieces OS interface explicitly shows that the feature is not available for Linux systems.\n\n### Current Behavior\n- Pieces OS shows a message indicating Long-Term Memory is not available for Linux\n- Long-Term Memory functionality does not work on the Linux platform\n- Other operating systems appear to have this feature working correctly\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- Long-Term Memory feature should be available and functional on Linux, as confirmed by the Discord team\n\n### Evidence\n- [Discord communication confirming feature availability](https://discord.com/channels/1098986658851999776/1320479548797882430/1320643614443048971)\n\n- ![Screenshot showing Pieces OS message about feature unavailability on Linux](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6cb2d0-ef52-4194-bd57-c8a84be2d0db)\n\n\n\n### Questions\n1. When can Linux users expect this feature to be fully available?\n2. Is there a planned timeline for Linux support?\n3. Are there any workarounds available in the meantime?\n\n### System Information\n- Operating System: Linux [Zorin OS 17.2 based on Linux 6.8.0-50-generic~22.04.1-Ubuntu]\n- Pieces OS Version: [PiecesOS 11.0.3]\n- Desktop App: [Pieces for Developers 3.3.2]\n\n### Additional Notes\nThis feature is currently working on other operating systems, and Linux users would greatly benefit from having access to this functionality.\n\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Long-Term Memory Feature\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* The Long-Term Memory (LTM) feature is currently in a testing phase and working on x11 but not on Wayland.\n* Discord Team incorrectly stated that the feature is available on Wayland.\n* The user, Michael-Obele, is facing issues with the feature not working on x11.\n* Another user, scotch86, is also facing the same issue.\n* The root cause seems to be a failing dependency that powers LTM.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* LTM not working on Wayland.\n* Discord Team providing incorrect information.\n* LTM not working for specific users even on x11.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* The team expects the feature to work on x11.\n* They requested the user to share logs for further diagnosis.\n* They suggested scheduling a video call to troubleshoot live.\n* They shared another GH issue with updates on the dependency problem.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The team is investigating the dependency issue and provided a link to another GH issue with updates.\n* They scheduled a video call with Michael-Obele for further troubleshooting.\n* There's no current solution for fixing the dependency issue.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The issue seems specific to certain configurations and not a general problem with all users on Wayland.\n* The team is actively working on resolving the issue and is grateful for user feedback and assistance.",

I can't disable LTM either. \n\nI read in another issue that running pieces-os as snap app, could be a problem for load other system dependencies. Don't know if this could help.\n\nDon't know which other info could be helpful\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: LTM Issues on Linux\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Scotch86 reported issues with LTM functionality on Ubuntu 24.10.\n* Simple LTM tasks such as asking about past activities or visited pages were not working.\n* Scotch86 provided logs and screenshots for troubleshooting.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* LTM was buggy on Linux, specifically Ubuntu 24.10.\n* User education on how to properly prompt LTM was lacking.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark-at-pieces acknowledged the issue and mentioned a fix would be available in EOD 11.0.3.\n* LTM context was enabled in settings.\n* Reinstalling the application from scratch was performed.\n* Advice on how to better prompt LTM was provided, including:\n    * Specifying a time range.\n    * Mentioning a specific topic or person.\n    * Focusing on a particular application.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue was acknowledged and fixed in version EOD 11.0.3.\n* User education on prompt improvement was provided.\n* The user was encouraged to test again and report any further issues.",

Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Summary of GitHub issue conversation:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* RamanBaig is experiencing an issue where the AI can't read files unless they are pasted into the chat directly, even when Long Term Memory is enabled. This is causing inconvenience with large files.\n* RamanBaig is using Claude sonnet 3.5 or gpt on Windows 11 Home.\n* The issue occurs with all folders and files, regardless of size or location.\n* RamanBaig is willing to schedule a call to help diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* AI cannot read files and relies on direct pasting into chat, causing inefficiency with large files.\n* This issue persists across different foundation models and Long Term Memory settings.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Sam-at-pieces suggests scheduling a call to gather more details and potentially reproduce the issue.\n* A few changes were made by Sam-at-pieces that could potentially resolve the issue.\n* Mark-at-pieces also offered a call to assist in diagnosing and fixing the problem.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* RamanBaig is open to scheduling a call with either Sam-at-pieces or Mark-at-pieces. \n* The outcome of the call and the fix for the issue are currently pending.",
