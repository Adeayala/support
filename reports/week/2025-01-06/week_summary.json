While the Discord team has confirmed that this feature should be available on Linux, the Pieces OS interface explicitly shows that the feature is not available for Linux systems.\n\n### Current Behavior\n- Pieces OS shows a message indicating Long-Term Memory is not available for Linux\n- Long-Term Memory functionality does not work on the Linux platform\n- Other operating systems appear to have this feature working correctly\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- Long-Term Memory feature should be available and functional on Linux, as confirmed by the Discord team\n\n### Evidence\n- [Discord communication confirming feature availability](https://discord.com/channels/1098986658851999776/1320479548797882430/1320643614443048971)\n\n- ![Screenshot showing Pieces OS message about feature unavailability on Linux](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6cb2d0-ef52-4194-bd57-c8a84be2d0db)\n\n\n\n### Questions\n1. When can Linux users expect this feature to be fully available?\n2. Is there a planned timeline for Linux support?\n3. Are there any workarounds available in the meantime?\n\n### System Information\n- Operating System: Linux [Zorin OS 17.2 based on Linux 6.8.0-50-generic~22.04.1-Ubuntu]\n- Pieces OS Version: [PiecesOS 11.0.3]\n- Desktop App: [Pieces for Developers 3.3.2]\n\n### Additional Notes\nThis feature is currently working on other operating systems, and Linux users would greatly benefit from having access to this functionality.\n\n## Long-Term Memory Feature Functionality Issue on Linux\n\n### Key Points:\n\n* Long-Term Memory (LTM) feature is currently in testing on Linux.\n* Feature works with X11 but has issues with Wayland.\n* Users are experiencing problems activating the LTM feature.\n* User has shared logs for troubleshooting.\n* Issue might be related to a failing dependency.\n\n### Problems Identified:\n\n* LTM feature doesn't work on Wayland.\n* Feature activation button doesn't work as expected.\n* Dependency issue affecting LTM functionality.\n\n### Solutions Proposed/Implemented:\n\n* Suggesting switching to X11 for LTM functionality.\n* Analyzing log files for troubleshooting.\n* Scheduling live troubleshooting call with user.\n* Working on deprecating the failing dependency.\n\n### Current Status/Outcome:\n\n* Problem is under investigation.\n* User has provided logs for analysis.\n* Live troubleshooting call scheduled for Thursday.\n* More information about the failing dependency provided in another GitHub issue (link shared).\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n* This summary focuses on the most important details but doesn't provide every detail in the conversation.",

I'm attempting to get the Pieces for Devs Obsidian plugin to work. The installation of the Pieces for Devs \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin\" goes seemingly faultless as it reports in green: \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin installed successfully\". \n\n However, as soon as I attempt to enable the plugin (v1.21.1)the following error pops up \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d. \n- Obsidian v1.7.7 is up to date, and running. \n- Pieces OS v11.0.3 is running, and \n- Pieces for Devs Desktop is up and running @ v3.3.3. \n- The OS is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 22H2, Build 19045.5247 updated 02-02-2025\n\nI have followed the guidelines in the following documentation (https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian).
