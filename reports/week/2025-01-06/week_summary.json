I'm attempting to get the Pieces for Devs Obsidian plugin to work. The installation of the Pieces for Devs \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin\" goes seemingly faultless as it reports in green: \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin installed successfully\". \n\n However, as soon as I attempt to enable the plugin (v1.21.1)the following error pops up \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d. \n- Obsidian v1.7.7 is up to date, and running. \n- Pieces OS v11.0.3 is running, and \n- Pieces for Devs Desktop is up and running @ v3.3.3. \n- The OS is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 22H2, Build 19045.5247 updated 02-02-2025\n\nI have followed the guidelines in the following documentation (https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian).

For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User is unable to access the contents of files despite the app recognizing the file names.\n* User believes this issue occurs with large files (thousands of lines of code).\n* User confirmed having Long Term Memory enabled and tested with both Claude sonnet 3.5 and gpt foundation models.\n* The issue persists across different folders and files.\n* User is running Windows 11 Home, 24H2.\n* The specific files mentioned include 3 files with thousands of lines of code and one file with 200-300 lines of code.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* The app is unable to read the contents of files.\n* This issue specifically affects large files.\n* The root cause of the issue remains unclear.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* The developer requests additional information to help reproduce the issue.\n* The developer suggests scheduling a call with the user for further investigation.\n* The developer mentions potential code changes that could resolve the issue.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue is still under investigation.\n* A call is scheduled with the user and the developer to further explore the problem.\n* A potential fix has been identified but requires further testing.",
