Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (RamanBaig) experiences difficulty getting Pieces to read file content despite recognizing the files' names. This issue was frustrating, especially for files with thousands of lines of code.\n* RamanBaig confirmed that Long Term Memory was enabled, tried different foundation models, and experienced the issue with all folders and files.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Reading file content within Pieces was not working consistently.\n* Difficulty reproducing the issue for troubleshooting.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Samantha (sam-at-pieces) requested additional information to reproduce the issue.\n* Samantha proposed a call with RamanBaig to gather more details.\n* Mark (mark-at-pieces) offered his calendar availability for a call if RamanBaig was unable to schedule with Samantha.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue was still under investigation and a resolution was not yet reached.\n* A call was scheduled between RamanBaig and Mark to further troubleshoot the problem.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue seemed to occur regardless of the foundation model used.\n* RamanBaig was using Windows 11 Home, 24H2.\n* The specific file size and file content were not identified. \n* The user was open to troubleshooting and provided all requested information.",
