Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* RamanBaig is experiencing difficulty with Pieces not reading files, even though it recognizes their existence.\n* This issue persists even when copying and pasting the code into the chat.\n* The issue occurs with both Claude and GPT models, and across various folders and files.\n* RamanBaig is using Windows 11 Home, 24H2, and has Long Term Memory enabled.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Pieces is unable to read file contents directly, requiring manual copy-paste.\n* This issue is particularly problematic for large files with thousands of lines of code.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Sam-at-pieces suggests collecting additional information, including Windows version, file count, and related files displayed.\n* They also propose scheduling a call to discuss the issue in detail and potentially reproduce it.\n* Sam-at-pieces mentions recent changes that might address the issue and suggests testing them with Mark-at-pieces.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* RamanBaig is available to schedule a call after 3 pm EST.\n* Sam-at-pieces suggests a call with Mark-at-pieces to further investigate and test potential solutions.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The exact cause of the problem remains unidentified.\n* A resolution is pending further investigation and testing.",
