I'm attempting to get the Pieces for Devs Obsidian plugin to work. The installation of the Pieces for Devs \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin\" goes seemingly faultless as it reports in green: \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin installed successfully\". \n\n However, as soon as I attempt to enable the plugin (v1.21.1)the following error pops up \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d. \n- Obsidian v1.7.7 is up to date, and running. \n- Pieces OS v11.0.3 is running, and \n- Pieces for Devs Desktop is up and running @ v3.3.3. \n- The OS is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 22H2, Build 19045.5247 updated 02-02-2025\n\nI have followed the guidelines in the following documentation (https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian).

For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User RamanBaig reported an issue where the model can recognize files and their names but cannot read their content.\n* This issue persists even with Long Term Memory enabled and across different foundation models.\n* The issue affects all folders and files, including those with thousands of lines of code.\n* User is running Windows 11 Home, 24H2 and has approximately 9 files in the folder, with only 4 actively used.\n* The issue has been difficult to reproduce for the developers.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Model cannot read content of files despite recognizing them.\n* Issue persists across different models and settings.\n* Issue affects all folders and files, regardless of size.\n* Difficulty in reproducing the issue for developers.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Developers are requesting additional information and may schedule a call to investigate further.\n* Developers have made changes that may resolve the issue.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is still under investigation.\n* Developers are working on a potential fix.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The user is using Windows 11 Home, 24H2.\n* The user has approximately 9 files in the folder, with only 4 actively used.\n* The issue affects files with thousands of lines of code.",

This cluttered the console and caused inconvenience.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- The errors arose from recent Pieces OS updates which removed a designated port for the software.\n- This led to Pieces OS checking for its API across various ports, causing the errors.\n- Rutvik110 initially assured that privacy was not compromised as the checks targeted only Pieces OS endpoints.\n- Lorenwest clarified that the main concern was the cluttering of the console, impacting their debugging workflow.\n- Rutvik acknowledged the issue and promised a fix in the upcoming patch update.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n- Rutvik initially aimed to suppress the error messages within the extension.\n- Further investigation revealed the issue's origin in Chrome and its handling of extension network requests.\n- A temporary solution suggested hiding network messages in the dev console settings.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n- The Chrome bug mentioned by Rutvik hasn't been officially addressed or fixed yet.\n- However, the team is likely looking for alternative solutions to handle the console cluttering or has opted for the temporary setting change suggestion.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- Lorenwest was informed about the root cause and potential solutions.\n- It remains unclear whether a permanent fix within Pieces OS or Chrome has been implemented.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The Chrome bug issue IDs provided can be used to track for further updates.\n- The conversation highlights the importance of clear communication and addressing user concerns about software behavior.",

I'm attempting to get the Pieces for Devs Obsidian plugin to work. The installation of the Pieces for Devs \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin\" goes seemingly faultless as it reports in green: \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin installed successfully\". \n\n However, as soon as I attempt to enable the plugin (v1.21.1)the following error pops up \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d. \n- Obsidian v1.7.7 is up to date, and running. \n- Pieces OS v11.0.3 is running, and \n- Pieces for Devs Desktop is up and running @ v3.3.3. \n- The OS is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 22H2, Build 19045.5247 updated 02-02-2025\n\nI have followed the guidelines in the following documentation (https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian). The install fails with a not-very-helpful answer. \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d\n\nReferring to the section \"https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian#having-trouble-with-the-pieces-for-developers-obsidian-plugin\" in the documentation still fails to provide the expected results, so the next step would be to attempt to find related installation logs that might shed light on the issue.\n\nI've searched for possible issues indicating this type of bug/issue but none were found here on GitHub.\nI had a look at the `obsidian.log` file in the `C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\obsidian` folder but there's no indication at all nor any mention of any plugins or installations related to such.\n\nRepeat uninstall/reinstall advice does not resolve the problem either.\nCould you indicate which other Pieces, Obsidian and Win-OS logs would be the most appropriate to investigate which might shed light on the cause, please?\n\n**Edit:**\nI'm using other plugins without any issues.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19b3dcd2-05fa-4171-ae2e-dc71b5ce451c)\n\nThank you for looking into this.\n## Conversation Summary: Debugging Obsidian Plugin\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Andre-ADPC was having trouble with the Pieces for Obsidian plugin.\n* bishoy-at-pieces asked them to share the developer console to diagnose the issue.\n* Andre-ADPC was initially confused about which \"console\" was being referred to.\n* bishoy-at-pieces clarified that the developer console within Obsidian was needed.\n* Andre-ADPC was then able to provide the requested information.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The Pieces for Obsidian plugin was not working as expected for Andre-ADPC.\n* The cause of the problem was not initially clear.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* bishoy-at-pieces suggested Andre-ADPC check the developer console in Obsidian.\n* Andre-ADPC was able to share the console information after receiving further clarification.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The conversation ended with Andre-ADPC providing the requested information.\n* It is unclear if the issue was resolved, as the conversation did not progress further.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation was respectful and helpful.\n* bishoy-at-pieces was patient and provided clear instructions.\n* Andre-ADPC was able to follow the instructions and provide the necessary information.",
