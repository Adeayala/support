It seems like you are running VS Code in a remote environment & Pieces for VS Code cannot connect to Pieces OS. Please refer to our documentation on how to resolve this issue.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffeb53fd-0787-4bc2-9faf-c5f3d179294b)\n\nPieces OS version:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/640d35af-6106-4717-9269-c51205ff23fb)\n\nI followed this guide but with no luck: https://docs.pieces.app/product-highlights-and-benefits/connecting-to-a-remote-pieces-os-instance\n\nLAN IP:\n\n<img width=\"567\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dfb849d-0764-4ae0-801c-c55f9b3e5d7e\" />\n\nVS Code settings, pieces custom URL:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaed7eb8-36e7-49cb-b6e0-84271adb8027)\n\nWhat else can I try?\n\nThanks!\n\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (malanciault) cannot connect to Pieces OS using VSCode extension when running in a remote Docker container.\n* The error occurs even when no VS Code project is open.\n* The user provided screenshots of the error messages and their VS Code configuration.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Starting from Pieces OS version 11.0.0, the default listening interface of Pieces Server is changed to loopback for security reasons. This prevents connections from remote clients like Docker containers.\n* The VSCode extension cannot resolve the `host.docker.internal` address used for communication within Docker.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Robert, a Pieces team member, suggests using the default port (39300) and the IP address of the Pieces OS machine (`http://192.168.0.129:39300`).\n* Malanciault confirms that this solution does not work.\n* Robert identifies the issue as a networking change in the latest Pieces OS release.\n* A patch is developed to allow Pieces Server to listen on all interfaces.\n* As a temporary workaround, Robert suggests creating a DNS entry for `pieceshost` and configuring it to resolve to `host.docker.internal` within the container and to `localhost` outside the container.\n* Version 2.0.1 of the VSCode extension is released with a fix for this issue.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Malanciault confirms that the issue persists even after updating the plugin.\n* Robert proposes a video call to troubleshoot the issue further.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue seems to be specific to remote Docker containers.\n* The workaround involving DNS configuration is complex and may not be suitable for all users.\n* The patch allowing Pieces Server to listen on all interfaces is the most promising solution.\n\n**Concise Summary:**\n\nA user reported an issue connecting to Pieces OS from a remote Docker container using the VSCode extension. The problem was identified as a networking change in Pieces OS that prevented connections from loopback addresses. A patch was developed and released in the VSCode extension to fix the issue. However, the user confirmed that the issue persists. A video call was proposed to troubleshoot the issue further.",

Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Key points raised:\n\n* RamanBaig reported that the AI could see file names and recognize relevant code files (e.g., index.html), but it couldn't read file content unless pasted into the chat. This was inconvenient for large files.\n* RamanBaig confirmed having Long Term Memory enabled, experiencing the issue with both Claude and GPT models, and having the issue across various project folders.\n* RamanBaig used Windows 11 Home, had ~9 files in the folder (4 of which were relevant with thousands of lines of code), and saw only 3 of those relevant files reflected in the \"related files\" tab.\n\n## Problems identified:\n\n* Limited file content reading - The AI could only read file content if pasted into the chat, limiting its access to large files.\n* Difficulty in reproducing - The developer struggled to reproduce the issue, hindering troubleshooting.\n\n## Solutions proposed/implemented:\n\n* The developer suggested scheduling a call with RamanBaig to further investigate the issue.\n* The developer mentioned potential changes made that could resolve the problem.\n\n## Current status/outcome:\n\n* A call with RamanBaig was scheduled to diagnose the issue and test potential solutions.\n* The developer proposed a call with another collaborator if the original time slot wasn't suitable. \n\n## Summary:\n\nRamanBaig reported a limitation in file content reading for large files. The developer couldn't reproduce the issue and suggested a call to gather more information and test potential fixes.
