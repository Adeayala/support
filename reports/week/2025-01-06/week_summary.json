Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* **Problem:** The user, RamanBaig, encounters an issue where Pieces can't read files even though it recognizes their names. This is particularly frustrating when dealing with large files with thousands of lines of code.\n* **Additional details:** The user provides information about their environment, including the operating system (Windows 11), foundation model (Claude and GPT), and project files.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* The developer, sam-at-pieces, suggests several possible solutions, including:\n    * **Gathering more information:** The developer asks for details about the Long Term Memory setting, number of files, and related files tab.\n    * **Reproducing the issue:** The developer tries to reproduce the issue on their own but is unable to.\n    * **Scheduling a call:** The developer proposes a call with the user to discuss the issue in more detail and attempt to reproduce it.\n    * **Testing changes:** The developer mentions making changes that could potentially resolve the issue.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* **Open issue:** The issue remains open as the developer seeks further information and attempts to reproduce the problem.\n* **Possible resolution:** The user is invited to schedule calls with the developer or another team member to continue troubleshooting.\n* **Next steps:** The user needs to confirm their availability for a call and potentially provide additional information about their setup.\n\n**Overall, the conversation highlights a collaborative effort between the user and developer to identify and resolve the issue. While the problem has not yet been fully resolved, the developer has taken several steps to understand and address the user's concerns.**",

Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* **Problem:** The user, RamanBaig, encounters an issue where Pieces can't read files even though it recognizes their names. This is particularly frustrating when dealing with large files with thousands of lines of code.\n* **Additional details:** The user provides information about their environment, including the operating system (Windows 11), foundation model (Claude and GPT), and project files.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* The developer, sam-at-pieces, suggests several possible solutions, including:\n    * **Gathering more information:** The developer asks for details about the Long Term Memory setting, number of files, and related files tab.\n    * **Reproducing the issue:** The developer tries to reproduce the issue on their own but is unable to.\n    * **Scheduling a call:** The developer proposes a call with the user to discuss the issue in more detail and attempt to reproduce it.\n    * **Testing changes:** The developer mentions making changes that could potentially resolve the issue.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* **Open issue:** The issue remains open as the developer seeks further information and attempts to reproduce the problem.\n* **Possible resolution:** The user is invited to schedule calls with the developer or another team member to continue troubleshooting.\n* **Next steps:** The user needs to confirm their availability for a call and potentially provide additional information about their setup.\n\n**Overall, the conversation highlights a collaborative effort between the user and developer to identify and resolve the issue. While the problem has not yet been fully resolved, the developer has taken several steps to understand and address the user's concerns.**",
