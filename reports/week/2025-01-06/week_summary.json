Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Issue:** Files in GitHub Copilot are not being read correctly, requiring users to copy and paste code into chat.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* Issue reported by RamanBaig on Jan 2nd, 2025.\n* Occurs with both Claude and gpt models.\n* Affects all folders and files.\n* Long term memory is enabled.\n* User is running Windows 11 Home.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Copilot cannot read file contents directly.\n* Users have to manually copy and paste code into chat, which is inefficient.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Sam-at-pieces requests additional information to reproduce the issue.\n* RamanBaig provides details on their system and files.\n* Sam-at-pieces suggests scheduling a call to further diagnose the problem.\n* Mark-at-pieces offers to assist with the call and provides their calendar link.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Issue remains unresolved, but a call with Sam-at-pieces or Mark-at-pieces is scheduled to investigate further.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Sam-at-pieces mentions potential bug fixes that may resolve the issue.",

I'm attempting to get the Pieces for Devs Obsidian plugin to work. The installation of the Pieces for Devs \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin\" goes seemingly faultless as it reports in green: \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin installed successfully\". \n\n However, as soon as I attempt to enable the plugin (v1.21.1)the following error pops up \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d. \n- Obsidian v1.7.7 is up to date, and running. \n- Pieces OS v11.0.3 is running, and \n- Pieces for Devs Desktop is up and running @ v3.3.3. \n- The OS is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 22H2, Build 19045.5247 updated 02-02-2025\n\nI have followed the guidelines in the following documentation (https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian).

Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Issue:** Files in GitHub Copilot are not being read correctly, requiring users to copy and paste code into chat.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* Issue reported by RamanBaig on Jan 2nd, 2025.\n* Occurs with both Claude and gpt models.\n* Affects all folders and files.\n* Long term memory is enabled.\n* User is running Windows 11 Home.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Copilot cannot read file contents directly.\n* Users have to manually copy and paste code into chat, which is inefficient.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Sam-at-pieces requests additional information to reproduce the issue.\n* RamanBaig provides details on their system and files.\n* Sam-at-pieces suggests scheduling a call to further diagnose the problem.\n* Mark-at-pieces offers to assist with the call and provides their calendar link.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Issue remains unresolved, but a call with Sam-at-pieces or Mark-at-pieces is scheduled to investigate further.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Sam-at-pieces mentions potential bug fixes that may resolve the issue.",
