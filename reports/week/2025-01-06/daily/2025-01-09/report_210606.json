Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Conversation Summary\n\n**Key points raised:**\n* User was unable to access files directly from chat, even though the system recognized their names.\n* User tried different foundation models (Claude, gpt) and encountered the issue across different folders.\n* The issue persisted regardless of the number of files.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n* Files were not accessible for direct interaction, requiring manual copy-pasting.\n* The cause of the issue was unknown and difficult to reproduce.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n* Sharing more details with the developer to help with troubleshooting.\n* Scheduling a call with the developer for further investigation.\n* Developer made some unconfirmed changes that may resolve the issue.\n* Scheduling a call with another developer to help diagnose the problem.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n* The root cause is still being investigated.\n* A potential solution has been implemented but its effectiveness remains unconfirmed.\n* A follow-up call with the user is planned to test the potential solution and gather more information.",

I'm attempting to get the Pieces for Devs Obsidian plugin to work. The installation of the Pieces for Devs \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin\" goes seemingly faultless as it reports in green: \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin installed successfully\". \n\n However, as soon as I attempt to enable the plugin (v1.21.1)the following error pops up \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d. \n- Obsidian v1.7.7 is up to date, and running. \n- Pieces OS v11.0.3 is running, and \n- Pieces for Devs Desktop is up and running @ v3.3.3. \n- The OS is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 22H2, Build 19045.5247 updated 02-02-2025\n\nI have followed the guidelines in the following documentation (https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian). The install fails with a not-very-helpful answer. \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d\n\nReferring to the section \"https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian#having-trouble-with-the-pieces-for-developers-obsidian-plugin\" in the documentation still fails to provide the expected results, so the next step would be to attempt to find related installation logs that might shed light on the issue.\n\nI've searched for possible issues indicating this type of bug/issue but none were found here on GitHub.\nI had a look at the `obsidian.log` file in the `C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\obsidian` folder but there's no indication at all nor any mention of any plugins or installations related to such.\n\nRepeat uninstall/reinstall advice does not resolve the problem either.\nCould you indicate which other Pieces, Obsidian and Win-OS logs would be the most appropriate to investigate which might shed light on the cause, please?\n\n**Edit:**\nI'm using other plugins without any issues.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19b3dcd2-05fa-4171-ae2e-dc71b5ce451c)\n\nThank you for looking into this.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Andre-ADPC encountered an issue with the Pieces for Obsidian plugin.\n* bishoy-at-pieces asked Andre-ADPC to share the console for debugging.\n* Andre-ADPC was initially confused about which console to share.\n* bishoy-at-pieces clarified that they were referring to the Obsidian developer console.\n* Andre-ADPC was instructed on how to access the Obsidian developer console and take a screenshot.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Andre-ADPC was unsure which console to share.\n* Andre-ADPC did not know how to access the Obsidian developer console.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Provide a clear explanation of which console to share.\n* Provide instructions on how to access the Obsidian developer console.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Andre-ADPC was able to access the Obsidian developer console and take a screenshot.\n* The issue was not resolved within the conversation, but Andre-ADPC was provided with the necessary information to continue troubleshooting.\n* The conversation ended with an offer of further assistance from bishoy-at-pieces.",
