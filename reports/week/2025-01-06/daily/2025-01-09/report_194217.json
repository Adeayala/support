Those issues was pieces os not working after a while. Not a big deal since I would just close it in task manager and reopen it once it was all closed to force a hard restart of the whole system. But, now (thanks for listening to my little rant up there) there is an issue that I cannot workaround. For some reason pieces cannot get any context from any files or folders, and its getting pretty annoying to the fact that I have started using other softwares because at least they can look at the files and suggest changes or edits that actually have something to do with my code. I believe this happened ever since i updated pieces os about 2-3 updates ago, but cannot pinpoint any specific cause. Another cause may be that fact that I downloaded Ollama but never really used it.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (RamanBaig) reported an issue where Pieces could not read files, even though it recognized their names.\n* The issue occurred with multiple files, including large ones with thousands of lines of code.\n* User was using Windows 11, Claude sonnet 3.5 and gpt foundation models, with Long Term Memory enabled.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Pieces was unable to read file content directly.\n* User had to manually copy and paste code into the chat, which was inconvenient and time-consuming.\n* The underlying cause of the issue was not clear.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Sam-at-pieces suggested several actions, including:\n    * Enabling Long Term Memory \n    * Trying different foundation models (Claude, gpt)\n    * Sharing specific files and folders experiencing the issue\n    * Providing details about the operating system\n    * Joining a call for further troubleshooting\n* Mark-at-pieces suggested scheduling a call to diagnose the issue.\n* Two calendar links were provided for scheduling calls with either Sam-at-pieces or Mark-at-pieces.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The user agreed to schedule a call with either Sam-at-pieces or Mark-at-pieces to further investigate the issue.\n* Two calendar links were provided for scheduling, but the user has not yet confirmed a specific time.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user reported using Windows 11 Home, 24H2 and having approximately 9 files in the affected folder, with 4 actively used.\n* The user also confirmed that the affected files were correctly displayed in the \"related files\" tab within the chat.\n\n**Overall, the issue remains unresolved, but further investigation through a scheduled call is planned.**",

I'm attempting to get the Pieces for Devs Obsidian plugin to work. The installation of the Pieces for Devs \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin\" goes seemingly faultless as it reports in green: \" Pieces for Obsidian plugin installed successfully\". \n\n However, as soon as I attempt to enable the plugin (v1.21.1)the following error pops up \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d. \n- Obsidian v1.7.7 is up to date, and running. \n- Pieces OS v11.0.3 is running, and \n- Pieces for Devs Desktop is up and running @ v3.3.3. \n- The OS is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 22H2, Build 19045.5247 updated 02-02-2025\n\nI have followed the guidelines in the following documentation (https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian). The install fails with a not-very-helpful answer. \u201dFailed to load plugin \u2018pieces-for-developers\u2019\u201d\n\nReferring to the section \"https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/obsidian#having-trouble-with-the-pieces-for-developers-obsidian-plugin\" in the documentation still fails to provide the expected results, so the next step would be to attempt to find related installation logs that might shed light on the issue.\n\nI've searched for possible issues indicating this type of bug/issue but none were found here on GitHub.\nI had a look at the `obsidian.log` file in the `C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\obsidian` folder but there's no indication at all nor any mention of any plugins or installations related to such.\n\nRepeat uninstall/reinstall advice does not resolve the problem either.\nCould you indicate which other Pieces, Obsidian and Win-OS logs would be the most appropriate to investigate which might shed light on the cause, please?\n\n**Edit:**\nI'm using other plugins without any issues.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19b3dcd2-05fa-4171-ae2e-dc71b5ce451c)\n\nThank you for looking into this.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User bishoy-at-pieces asks Andre-ADPC to share their console to help with debugging.\n* Andre-ADPC misunderstands the request due to differences in perspective and assumptions.\n* bishoy-at-pieces clarifies the request and provides instructions on accessing the Obsidian developer console.\n* Andre-ADPC takes a screenshot of the developer console and shares it with bishoy-at-pieces.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Difficulty in communication due to different perspectives and assumptions.\n* Andre-ADPC's misunderstanding of the request.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Bishoy-at-pieces provides clear instructions and references relevant resources.\n* Andre-ADPC follows the instructions and shares the requested information.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue seems to be resolved with Andre-ADPC providing the necessary information.\n* Further communication or troubleshooting may be needed depending on the content of the developer console screenshot.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of clear communication and providing context when troubleshooting technical issues.\n* The use of screenshots can be helpful in resolving issues remotely.\n* The issue conversation is ongoing as of 2023-11-13.",
