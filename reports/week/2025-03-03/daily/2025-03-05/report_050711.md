## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving performance issues:** The most frequent complaints revolve around Pieces OS performance, particularly high CPU usage linked to Long Term Memory. Focus development efforts on optimizing LTM functionality and resolving these issues to improve user experience.
- **Investigate local processing mode:** Several tickets report problems with Pieces Copilot and LTM when in local processing mode. Thoroughly test and debug this mode to ensure its stability and functionality.
- **Improve LLM download experience:** Address the bug preventing cancellation of LLM downloads and explore ways to make the download process smoother and more user-friendly.
- **Consider a more detailed issue template:** While the current template captures basic information, it could benefit from more specific prompts about LTM settings, processing mode, and steps to reproduce the issue. This would help in diagnosing and resolving issues more efficiently.
- **Proactively communicate known issues:** Maintain a visible and updated list of known issues and workarounds on the Pieces website or support forum. This can help users self-resolve common problems and reduce the influx of support tickets.
- **Gather more detailed system information:** When users encounter performance issues, automatically collect system specifications (CPU, RAM, OS version) to aid in troubleshooting and identifying potential hardware limitations.
- **Analyze ticket trends over time:** Regularly analyze support ticket data to identify recurring issues, emerging trends, and areas where documentation or product improvements are needed. This proactive approach can help prevent future issues and improve overall support efficiency.
