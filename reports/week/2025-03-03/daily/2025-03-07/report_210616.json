    "**Improve \"Secret Message\" functionality:** Investigate and resolve the problems with the \"Secret Message\" example on macOS to ensure its intended functionality and user experience.",
    "**Gather more data on VS extension:** Collect more data and feedback on the VS extension's performance and potential conflicts to identify any underlying patterns or specific triggers.",
    "**Optimize LTM for resource usage:** Explore ways to optimize LTM's resource consumption, potentially through configuration options or performance improvements, to minimize its impact on system resources.",
    "**Improve error messaging:** Review and enhance error messages, particularly the \"device constraints\" error, to provide users with clearer information and facilitate troubleshooting.",
    "**Proactive communication:** Keep users informed about the status of these common issues and any ongoing efforts to resolve them. This could be through in-app notifications, blog posts, or forum updates.",
    "**Develop troubleshooting guides:** Create comprehensive troubleshooting guides for common issues, including step-by-step instructions and potential workarounds. This will empower users to resolve issues independently and reduce support requests.",
    "**Performance testing and optimization:** Implement rigorous performance testing as part of the development process to identify and address performance bottlenecks early on. Regularly optimize the software to ensure smooth and efficient operation across different hardware and software configurations.",
    "**User feedback mechanisms:** Establish robust channels for gathering user feedback, such as in-app surveys, forums, and social media monitoring. Actively solicit feedback on performance, usability, and any recurring issues to inform future development and support efforts."
