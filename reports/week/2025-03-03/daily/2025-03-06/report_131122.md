## Common Issues
### 1. PiecesOS High CPU and Memory Usage
Users report PiecesOS consuming excessive CPU and memory, especially with Long Term Memory (LTM) enabled. This causes system slowdowns and impacts performance. Solutions include software updates (versions 11.1.0 and LTM-2) with database and ML processing optimizations. While some improvements are noted, issues persist. The Pieces team is actively investigating and working on further optimizations.
