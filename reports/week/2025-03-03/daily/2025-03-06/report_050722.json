While the root cause is unclear, it's potentially linked to internet connectivity or the Live Context feature.  Short-term solutions include restarting PiecesOS and using the Optimize Memory button. Version 11.1.0 and LTM-2 offer some improvements, but the issue persists for some users. The PiecesOS team is actively investigating and welcomes user feedback.",

          "text": "PiecesOS using too much RAM/spike in CPU\nSeveral users have called in recently about Pieces using too much RAM or causing a spike in CPU up to 100%. We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue #676: High Memory and CPU Usage in Pieces OS\n\n**Key points raised:**\n* High memory usage (up to 5GB) reported by multiple users, even with no models installed or running\n* Live Context feature speculated to contribute due to keeping track of all user actions\n* High CPU spikes (up to 50% and 100%) observed, slowing down entire systems\n\n**Problems identified:**\n* High resource consumption hindering user experience and system performance\n* Underlying cause not definitively identified\n* Memory leak suspected\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n* Optimize Memory button to unload current models and free RAM\n* PiecesOS version 11.1.0 released, replacing heavy database technology\n* LTM-2 released with further improvements\n* User suggestion to use E-cores for PiecesOS to manage CPU load\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n* Issue remains open, but marked as needing verification\n* Some users report reductions in RAM & CPU with 11.1.0 and LTM-2\n* Others still experience high resource usage, indicating ongoing problems\n\n## Additional Notes:\n* Memory usage expected for CPU/GPU LLM execution\n* PiecesOS team actively investigating the issue and encouraging user feedback\n\n## Conclusion:\nWhile improvements have been implemented, high resource usage remains a concern for some users. The PiecesOS team continues to work towards a resolution.",
