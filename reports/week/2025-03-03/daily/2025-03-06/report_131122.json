After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage in PiecesOS, impacting performance.\n* Discord shows hiccups even after hotfix implementation.\n* Microsoft Edge experiences sluggish scrolling.\n* Long Term Memory (LTM) engine seems to be connected to the issue.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* High CPU usage across different hardware and platforms.\n* Performance issues persist even after hotfix release.\n* Microsoft Edge responsiveness continues to be sluggish.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Hotfix released to address performance issues.\n* Additional patch released for further improvement.\n* Development team investigating further solutions.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Marginal improvement observed, but issues with Discord and Microsoft Edge persist.\n* Detailed reports and screenshots provided by users to help guide troubleshooting.\n\n**Further action:**\n\n* Development team actively addressing the issue.\n* Users providing continuous feedback and information.\n\n\nThis is just a quick summary of the conversation. It is recommended to read the full conversation for further understanding of the issue and its current resolution status.",

We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Several users reported excessive memory and CPU usage by PiecesOS, impacting system performance.\n* High resource usage was attributed to heavy database technologies and on-device ML processing.\n* Some users found disabling Long-Term Memory (LTM) helped reduce resource consumption.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* High memory usage (up to 5GB)\n* High CPU usage (up to 100%)\n* System slowdowns and unresponsiveness\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* **11.1.0 Release:** Replaced heavier database technologies to improve memory and CPU usage.\n* **LTM-2 Update:** Further optimizations for on-device ML processing.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Initial reports after 11.1.0 release showed positive results, with reduced resource consumption for some users.\n* However, some users still experienced high CPU and memory usage after LTM-2 update.\n\n**Actionable Next Steps:**\n\n* Further investigate the root cause of remaining resource utilization issues.\n* Prioritize and implement additional optimizations.\n* Provide users with clear updates on progress and potential workarounds.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Users may temporarily turn off LTM or utilize task manager settings to limit PiecesOS resource usage.\n* PiecesOS developers are actively working to address resource-related concerns and improve overall performance.\n\n**Please note:** This summary focuses on the identified problems and solutions discussed in the conversation. Future updates may address additional points not covered here.",
