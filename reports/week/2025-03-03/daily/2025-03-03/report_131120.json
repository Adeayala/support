      "description": "Users are experiencing immediate \"Ollama failed to install\" errors within the Pieces desktop app on Linux. This stems from strict snap package confinement preventing access to necessary tools like 'curl'. Proposed solutions involve patching the package for sandboxed Ollama use. A permanent fix is under development, but no ETA is available, causing user frustration due to blocked workflows.",
