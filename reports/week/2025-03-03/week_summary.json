After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: High CPU Usage with LTM2\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* LTM2 feature causes high CPU usage on some systems, particularly with Microsoft Edge and certain configurations.\n* Issue persists across macOS and Windows.\n* Potential correlation between CPU usage and number of open tabs in Edge.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* High CPU usage impacting performance and responsiveness.\n* Inconsistent behavior, with some users experiencing significant improvements after updating Microsoft Edge and WebView2 Runtimes.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Investigating CPU usage on macOS/Windows in relation to LTM2.\n* Patches released for Pieces OS 11.2.2, with further fixes planned for the following week.\n* Users explored temporary workarounds involving reduced number of open tabs and adjusting file locations.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Issue partially resolved for some users with updated Edge and WebView2 Runtimes.\n* Root cause still under investigation.\n* Further fixes are expected in the upcoming week.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of collaborative troubleshooting within the user community.\n* Ongoing communication and updates are provided by the Pieces team.",
