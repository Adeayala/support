After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Issue: High CPU usage by Pieces OS on Linux Mint 22.1.\n* Opened by: epikkoder\n* Time: 2025-03-04T19:22:23+00:00\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Excessive CPU usage, potentially impacting system performance.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Hotfix developed and released by the Pieces team.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Hotfix available for installation. User confirmation needed to verify if performance improves.",
