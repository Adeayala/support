After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage with LTM (Long Term Memory) engine in PiecesOS\n* Discord and Microsoft Edge affected most\n* Problem persists across different hardware and Windows versions\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Performance issues with LTM engine causing high CPU usage\n* Reduced responsiveness in Discord and Microsoft Edge\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Hotfix released for PiecesOS\n* Patch for 11.2.2 to improve CPU usage\n* Further investigation into WebView interactions with LTM\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Improved performance with LTM engine compared to earlier versions\n* Some CPU spikes still observed with heavy browser usage\n* Continued investigation and optimization underway\n\n**Additional observations:**\n\n* Issue seems related to interaction between LTM and WebView in Edge\n* Limiting browser tabs reduces impact on CPU usage\n* User reports improvement with fewer tabs and LTM enabled\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe issue of high CPU usage with LTM has been partially addressed with released patches. Further investigation and optimization are ongoing to fully resolve the problem and improve overall performance.",
