After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub issue conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage with Pieces OS on various versions (11.2.1 and 11.2.2) and platforms (Windows 10, Windows 11).\n* Issues specifically noted with Discord and MS Edge.\n* CPU usage particularly high with Long Term Memory engine (LTM2).\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* High CPU usage impacting performance.\n* Specific applications (Discord, MS Edge) causing hiccups.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Hotfixes released by the Pieces team.\n* Update to Microsoft Edge and WebView2 Runtime.\n* Moving com.pieces.os/com.pieces.pfd folder to another drive and creating symbolic links.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Patch for high CPU issue has been released, resulting in some marginal improvements.\n* Updating Edge and WebView2 resolves the issue with MS Edge.\n* Moving com.pieces.os/com.pieces.pfd folder and creating symbolic links shows promise but needs further testing.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The issue appears to be highly related to LTM2.\n* Further investigation into the root cause is ongoing.",

We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue Discussion: High Memory and CPU Usage in Pieces OS\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n* Pieces OS has been experiencing high memory and CPU usage, impacting user experience and performance.\n* This issue has been prevalent across various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n* The memory usage issue is attributed to numerous factors, including ML models, data processing, and the new Live Context feature.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n* High RAM usage, exceeding 2GB even with no models running.\n* CPU spikes reaching 100% and slowing down entire systems.\n* Background processes continuously consuming resources.\n* Memory leaks causing instability.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n* Implementing a \"lite\" mode with reduced functionalities and resource demands.\n* Replacing heavy database technologies in PiecesOS 11.1.0 to improve CPU and memory usage.\n* Optimizing ML models and data processing for better efficiency.\n* Allowing users to set process affinity to specific cores (e.g., E-cores) for better temperature management.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n* The release of PiecesOS 11.1.0 has reportedly reduced CPU usage for some users.\n* Further improvements are planned and under development.\n* The issue of high memory usage persists for some users, even after the LTM-2 update.\n* The team is still actively investigating and addressing the problems.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Pieces OS team is aware of the high memory and CPU usage issues and actively working on solutions. While some improvements have been made, further optimization is needed. Users can expect additional updates and improvements in future releases.",
