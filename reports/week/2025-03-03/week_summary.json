We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* High RAM and CPU usage reported by users\n* Some users experiencing memory leaks and significant performance impact\n* Concerns about the functionality of Live Context and the \"Optimize Memory\" feature\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Pieces OS consumes a large amount of memory and CPU resources, even when not actively being used.\n* The issue seems widespread across various operating systems and hardware configurations.\n* High resource usage impacts overall system performance and user experience.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The Pieces team identified and replaced two heavy database technologies in version 11.1.0 to address memory and CPU issues.\n* An \"Optimize Memory\" feature was implemented to unload unused ML models and free up RAM.\n* The team is actively working on additional fixes to improve resource usage.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Version 11.1.0 has shown a significant improvement for some users, with reduced CPU and memory usage.\n* However, some users are still experiencing high resource usage, even after the LTM-2 update.\n* The Pieces team continues to investigate the issue and work on further solutions.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The high resource usage could be related to the functionality of Live Context and its underlying technology.\n* Some users suggest a \"lite\" mode with fewer features could be beneficial for those who prioritize resource efficiency over advanced functionality.\n\n## Overall, the conversation highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing performance and functionality in resource-intensive applications like Pieces OS. The Pieces team is actively working on improvements, and their efforts are showing positive results for some users. However, further optimization is needed to ensure a smooth and efficient experience for all.",
