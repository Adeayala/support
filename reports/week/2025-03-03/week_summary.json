After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Conversation Summary: Pieces Support Issue \n**Issue:** High CPU usage in PiecesOS\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* User @epikkoder reported high CPU usage in PiecesOS.\n* This issue was routed to the Pieces team and found similar to previous reports.\n* Pieces team confirmed a fix was in progress.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n* A hotfix has been released.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* User is requested to update PiecesOS and confirm if performance improves.\n* Current status is unclear, pending user's confirmation.\n\n**Other resources:**\n* Existing issues\n* Documentation\n* YouTube channel",
