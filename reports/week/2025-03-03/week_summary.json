We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot!
