We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: High RAM and CPU Usage in PiecesOS\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Several users reported high RAM and CPU usage by PiecesOS, impacting system performance.\n* Some users experienced RAM usage exceeding 5GB, even while not actively using PiecesOS.\n* Others reported consistently high CPU usage, reaching 100% in some cases.\n* The issue appears to be more prevalent on specific hardware configurations, such as M3 Pro MacBooks.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* High RAM and CPU usage can significantly impact system performance and user experience.\n* The issue potentially stems from PiecesOS's reliance on heavy database technologies and on-device ML processing.\n* Unclear triggers exist for the high resource usage spikes.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* PiecesOS developers implemented a fix in version 11.1.0, replacing heavy database technologies.\n* The team is actively working on additional improvements to further reduce resource consumption.\n* Users suggested disabling Live Context functionality to potentially reduce RAM usage.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The 11.1.0 update has reportedly improved CPU and RAM usage for some users.\n* However, others still experience significant resource consumption, especially on M3 Pro MacBooks.\n* The development team continues to investigate and address the issue.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The issue remains open as of 2025-03-05, with ongoing investigation and updates expected.\n* Users are encouraged to provide feedback and report their experiences to help the developers identify and resolve the problem.",

After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs.
