After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: High CPU Usage in Pieces OS\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage in Pieces OS, especially after the introduction of LTM2.\n* The issue affects various applications, including Discord, Microsoft Edge, and VSCode.\n* The problem persists even after updates and appears to be related to the number of open tabs in Edge.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* CPU usage spikes significantly, impacting performance and causing slowdowns.\n* The issue seems to be related to LTM2 and potentially the interaction between Pieces OS and Microsoft Edge/WebView2.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The Pieces team released several patches to address the issue.\n* Users identified a potential workaround by minimizing the number of open tabs in Edge.\n* Moving data folders to a separate ReFS drive and creating symbolic links improved performance for one user.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue appears to be partially resolved with the latest patches.\n* However, some users are still experiencing occasional CPU spikes.\n* The Pieces team is actively investigating the root cause and working on a permanent fix.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of user feedback in identifying and resolving issues.\n* The potential workaround suggests that the issue may be related to memory management or resource allocation.\n* The team's ongoing investigation and commitment to resolving the issue are encouraging.",

We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue #676: PiecesOS High Memory & CPU Usage\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Users are experiencing high memory and CPU usage by PiecesOS, even when not actively used.\n* Some users report memory usage exceeding 5GB and CPU usage reaching 100%.\n* This issue significantly impacts system performance.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Memory leaks in PiecesOS.\n* High resource consumption due to features like Live Context and Workstream Pattern Engine.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Memory optimization feature to unload unused ML models.\n* Release of PiecesOS 11.1.0 replacing heavy database technologies.\n* Further development to improve memory and CPU usage.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The latest update (11.1.0) has reportedly improved CPU and memory usage for some users.\n* However, the issue persists for others, especially with LTM-2 enabled.\n* The development team is actively working on further optimizations.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Users can set PiecesOS to use specific CPU cores to manage resource allocation.\n* Disabling Live Context can reduce memory consumption.\n\n**Overall, the issue of high resource usage by PiecesOS is acknowledged and actively addressed by the development team.
