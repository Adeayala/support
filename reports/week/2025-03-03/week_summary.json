After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation - High CPU Usage on Pieces OS\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Issue: High CPU usage on Pieces OS, especially when using Discord and Microsoft Edge with many tabs.\n* Reported by: `epikkoder`, `KnifMelti`, `cbchow`\n* Operating Systems: Windows 10, Windows 11\n* Hardware: Various configurations\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* High CPU usage with LTM2 enabled.\n* Severe lag on Discord and Microsoft Edge with many tabs.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Hotfix released on 2025-03-05 to improve performance.\n* Additional patch released on 2025-03-06.\n* Potential connection to Microsoft Edge and WebView2 updates (version 134.0.3124.51).\n* Shifting com.pieces.os/com.pieces.pfd folders to a ReFS drive with symbolic links.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue seems partially resolved with the latest updates.\n* Some users still experience high CPU usage, especially with heavy workloads.\n* Further investigation is ongoing by the Pieces team.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue is likely related to LTM2 and WebView2 components.\n* Certain configurations and workloads may still be affected.\n* Further updates and optimizations are expected.",
