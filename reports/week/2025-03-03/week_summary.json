          "text": "PiecesOS using too much RAM/spike in CPU\nSeveral users have called in recently about Pieces using too much RAM or causing a spike in CPU up to 100%. We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue: PiecesOS High Memory Usage\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* High memory usage of PiecesOS, ranging from 2GB to 5GB.\n* Some users experience high CPU usage as well, up to 100% in some cases.\n* Memory usage increases despite \"Optimize Memory\" option.\n* The issue persists even with minimal model usage and no active development.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* High memory footprint of PiecesOS impacting system performance.\n* Suspected memory leak causing uncontrolled memory consumption.\n* Potential performance issues due to resource intensive processing and on-device ML capabilities.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Identified and replaced two heavy database technologies (PiecesOS 11.1.0 release).\n* Implemented \"Optimize Memory\" feature to unload unused ML models.\n* Continuous efforts to improve memory and CPU performance.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Memory usage after the 11.1.0 release is reported to be around 2GB with potential for further improvements.\n* However, some users are still experiencing high CPU usage, particularly with LTM-2 update.\n* Further investigation and optimization efforts are ongoing to address these issues.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue was raised in April 2024 and is still open as of March 2025.\n* While the initial issue of high memory usage has been partially addressed, CPU usage problems persist and require further attention.",
