After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User `epikkoder` reported an issue with high CPU usage on Pieces OS.\n* The issue was automatically routed to the Pieces team.\n* Author `hra42` from the Pieces team responded that a hotfix is being worked on.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* High CPU usage on Pieces OS.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* A hotfix is being developed by the Pieces team.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is being addressed with a hotfix.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The author provided links to related issues and helpful resources.\n\n**Note:** This summary is based on the information provided in the conversation. As the conversation is ongoing, the status and outcome may change.",
