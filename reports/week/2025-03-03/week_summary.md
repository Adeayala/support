## Common Issues
### 1. Ollama installation fails in Pieces OS snap
Users are experiencing issues with Ollama installation on Linux systems, specifically when Pieces OS is installed as a snap. The snap's confinement restricts access to necessary resources like 'curl', causing the installation to fail. A fix is in progress to modify the snap definition and allow Ollama to function within the sandbox environment.
