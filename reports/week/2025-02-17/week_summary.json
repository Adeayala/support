The main points are:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* **Problem:** PiecesOS is taking a long time to boot up and is getting stuck at \"Ensure core dependency\" in the desktop application.\n* **Identified Issues:**\n    * Major data migration issue with version 11.1.0.\n    * Self-signed certificate issue causing handshake errors.\n    * Potential compatibility issues with Atlas OS.\n* **Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n    * Update to version 11.1.1 (resolved for some users).\n    * Update to version 11.1.2 (resolved for some users).\n    * Use appInstaller build instead of exe installer.\n    * Contact support for further assistance.\n    * Uninstall and reinstall the application.\n    * Restart the application.\n    * Manually move files back.\n    * Wait for patch release (3.3.8).\n* **Current Status/Outcome:**\n    * Most users are now resolved.\n    * A patch is being released to prevent future issues.\n    * The user on MacOS is now experiencing a different issue and will create a new ticket.\n\n**Problem Identified:** The specific problem identified in this conversation is that PiecesOS is taking a long time to boot up and is getting stuck at \"Ensure core dependency\" in the desktop application. This issue appears to be related to a major data migration with version 11.1.0, as well as potential compatibility issues with Atlas OS.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:** Several solutions were proposed and implemented to address the issue, including updating to version 11.1.1, using the appInstaller build, contacting support, restarting the application, and waiting for a patch release.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:** The issue appears to be resolved for most users who have updated to the latest version. However, one user on MacOS is still experiencing the issue and will create a new ticket.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user on MacOS is experiencing a different issue and will create a new ticket.\n* The link in the PiecesOS app for creating a new issue does not work very well if Firefox is set as the default browser on Windows.\n\n## Response to User Questions\n\n**Question 1:** What is the number of the log file you are referring to?\n\n**Answer:** The log file is named \"log-02162025.txt\" and is attached to the GitHub issue.\n\n**Question 2:** How old is your windows machine?\n\n**Answer:** The user's Windows machine is old, but the specific age is not mentioned.\n\n**Question 3:** Can you provide the name/version of your CPU?\n\n**Answer:** The user does not provide the name/version of their CPU.\n\n**Question 4:** Can you confirm that you have the latest version of Windows 10 installed?\n\n**Answer:** The user confirms that they have the latest version of Windows 10 installed.\n\n**Question 5:** Can you confirm that you have the correct hash for the file?\n\n**Answer:** The user does not confirm that they have the correct hash for the file.\n\n**Question 6:** Can you confirm that you have the correct files in the specified location?\n\n**Answer:** The user does not confirm that they have the correct files in the specified location.\n\n**Question 7:** Can you confirm that you have closed and reopened the app after the update?\n\n**Answer:** The user confirms that they have closed and reopened the app after the update.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nThis conversation highlights the importance of providing clear and concise information when reporting issues. It also shows that it is important to be patient when waiting for solutions to be implemented.\n\nOverall, the PiecesOS team appears to be responsive and helpful in addressing user issues.",

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance.

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolving PiecesOS launch failures:** The most frequent and active tickets relate to PiecesOS failing to launch, particularly after updates. Focus on addressing the root causes, such as hardware compatibility (AVX2 support), data migration issues, and self-signed certificate errors.",
    "**Improve communication about updates and compatibility:** Clearly communicate hardware and software requirements for PiecesOS updates to prevent users from encountering issues after updating. Provide clear instructions for troubleshooting common update problems.",
    "**Enhance error messaging and troubleshooting documentation:** Provide more informative error messages to users, enabling them to self-diagnose and resolve issues. Improve troubleshooting documentation, particularly for launch failures, connectivity problems, and local LLM integration.",
    "**Investigate and address cloud service connectivity issues:** Several users reported difficulties connecting to Pieces cloud services and local LLMs. Investigate the root causes, such as firewall configurations, network settings, and local model compatibility, and provide solutions or workarounds.",
    "**Monitor user feedback for emerging issues:** Continuously monitor support tickets and community forums for emerging trends or new issues. Proactively address these issues to prevent them from becoming widespread problems.",
    "**Consider implementing a system for early testing and feedback on updates:** Before releasing major updates, consider implementing a beta testing program or other mechanisms to gather early feedback from users. This can help identify and address potential issues before they impact a wider user base."
