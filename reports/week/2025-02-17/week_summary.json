However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance.

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolving PiecesOS launch failures:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around PiecesOS failing to launch, particularly after the 11.1.1 update. Focus on addressing the root causes, such as AVX2 dependency and database errors, to prevent similar issues in future releases.",
    "**Improve communication about hardware/software requirements:** Clearly communicate any changes in hardware or software requirements to users before they upgrade to avoid compatibility issues. Provide detailed system requirements documentation and highlight potential compatibility issues with older hardware.",
    "**Develop a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for launch failures:** Create a dedicated section in the support documentation that specifically addresses PiecesOS launch failures. Include step-by-step instructions for common solutions, such as checking system requirements, updating to the latest version, and providing logs for debugging.",
    "**Enhance error messaging and logging:** Improve error messages to provide more specific information about the cause of the launch failure. Encourage users to submit detailed logs when reporting issues to aid in faster diagnosis and resolution.",
    "**Consider a more robust beta testing program:** Implement a more comprehensive beta testing program to identify and address potential issues before releasing new versions to the public. This will help minimize the impact of bugs and compatibility problems on users."
