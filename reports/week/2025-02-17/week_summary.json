However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance. Thanks!\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Issue:** Rohanrathi99 reported difficulty in making requests to Pieces cloud services and using local models.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Rohanrathi99 shared screenshots showing the error messages.\n* Mark-at-pieces suspected firewall or network configuration issues blocking outgoing requests.\n* Rohanrathi99 uploaded the requested log files to Google Drive.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n* Mark-at-pieces requested access to the log files for further investigation.\n* Rohanrathi99 granted access to the files.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n* Mark-at-pieces has access to the log files and will likely analyze them to diagnose the problem and propose a solution.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* Pending resolution.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Rohanrathi99 was offered helpful resources while awaiting a response.\n* Mark-at-pieces provided a link to their calendar for real-time debugging if preferred.\n\nI hope this summary is concise and informative.
