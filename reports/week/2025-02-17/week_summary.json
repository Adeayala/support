  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize Hardware Compatibility Testing:** The influx of \"PiecesOS Launch Issues\" related to hardware incompatibility after the 11.1.1 update highlights the need for more robust testing across a wider range of hardware configurations before major releases.",
    "**Improve Communication on Update Impacts:**  Clearly communicate hardware requirements or potential compatibility issues to users before they update to a new version of PiecesOS. This could involve release notes, in-app notifications, or blog posts.",
    "**Enhance AVX2 Support Documentation:** Provide clear and accessible documentation for users about AVX2 support requirements, including how to check their system's compatibility and potential workarounds if their hardware doesn't meet the requirements.",
    "**Investigate and Optimize Core Services Boot Time:** The report of slow boot times related to \"core services\" warrants further investigation. Optimizing core services startup can significantly improve the user experience."
