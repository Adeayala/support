Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User is unable to link their GitHub and Google accounts in Pieces app.\n* Current account linking flow is not user-friendly and needs improvement.\n* There is a single character capitalization difference in user's email addresses for GitHub and Google accounts.\n* User is willing to wait for the new account linking system to be implemented.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow is not straightforward and confusing.\n* Capitalization difference in email addresses might be causing linking issues.\n* Old auth service provider has limitations and causes annoyances.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Manually merging accounts by Pieces support.\n* User provided screen recording of the linking flow for troubleshooting.\n* Resetting user's GitHub account for linking attempt.\n* Implementing a new account linking system in the next few weeks.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* User is waiting for the new account linking system to be implemented.\n* Existing linking attempts were unsuccessful due to potential capitalization issue.\n* Pieces support is resetting user's GitHub account for future attempt. \n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* User is a senior IT engineer and believes the capitalization difference should not be causing the issue.\n* User is willing to be staged for early access to the new account linking system.\n\n**Overall, the issue is still ongoing and will be resolved with the implementation of the new account linking system.**",

My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Ollama Server Issues on Pieces OS\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User `johnkennyuk` encountered CUDA errors (specifically `cublas64_12.dll`) when using Ollama server on Pieces OS.\n* The issue seemed related to an incomplete/broken installation or conflicts arising due to multiple Ollama installations.\n* The user eventually resolved the issue after several uninstalls, path cleanups, and ensuring only one Ollama instance was running at a time.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Multiple Ollama installations conflicting with each other.\n* Broken or incomplete Ollama installation causing Cuda errors.\n* Pieces OS trying to start its own Ollama instance even when an external instance was already running.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Uninstalling Ollama and Pieces OS completely and then reinstalling them.\n* Ensuring only one Ollama instance is running at a time.\n* Cleaning up environment paths and ensuring they point to the correct Ollama installation.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue seems to be resolved for the user after several troubleshooting steps.\n* The user requests additional features in Pieces OS to better handle external Ollama instances.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The exact cause of the issue remains unclear, but it might be related to a conflict between Pieces OS and externally installed Ollama.\n* The user suggests improvements to Pieces OS for better detection and management of external Ollama instances.",
