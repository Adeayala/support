This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance.

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize addressing PiecesOS launch failures:** The most frequent and active tickets revolve around PiecesOS failing to launch, particularly after updates (versions 11.1.1 and 11.1.2). Focus on identifying the root causes of these launch issues and implementing permanent fixes.",
    "**Improve communication about hardware requirements:** Several launch failures stem from stricter hardware requirements, especially AVX2 CPU support. Clearly communicate these requirements on the download page, installation instructions, and release notes to prevent user frustration.",
    "**Develop more robust update mechanisms:** Issues arising from updates suggest potential improvements in the update process. Implement rigorous testing for new versions across different operating systems and hardware configurations before release.",
    "**Enhance error messaging and logging:** Provide users with more informative error messages that pinpoint the cause of the issue and suggest potential solutions. Improve logging mechanisms to help support engineers quickly diagnose and debug problems.",
    "**Create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide:** Develop a detailed troubleshooting guide addressing common issues like launch failures, connectivity problems, and database errors. This guide should be easily accessible within the application and on the Pieces website.",
    "**Consider a dedicated support forum:** A dedicated support forum can provide a centralized platform for users to seek help, share solutions, and discuss issues. This can foster a sense of community and reduce the load on the support team.",
    "**Proactively monitor system health and performance:** Implement monitoring tools to track system health, performance, and user feedback. This allows for early detection of potential issues and proactive communication with users about ongoing problems or planned maintenance."
