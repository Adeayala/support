Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n* User was unable to link their Google and GitHub accounts due to an issue with the existing account linking flow. This resulted in two separate accounts being created for the user.\n* The user needed one of the accounts to be designated as their primary account and the other account to be merged into it.\n\n**Proposed Solutions:**\n\n* Meet with the user to manually resolve the issue by merging the two accounts.\n* Have the user sign out and back in to trigger the account linking flow.\n* Wait for the new authentication service to be implemented, which would address the account linking issues.\n\n**Implemented Solutions:**\n\n* The user provided their email addresses, allowing the support representative to identify the correct accounts.\n* The support representative initially tried to have the user sign out and back in to trigger the account linking flow.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The initial attempt to resolve the issue by having the user sign out and back in was unsuccessful.\n* The support representative identified a possible case sensitivity issue with the user's email addresses. \n* The user decided to wait for the new authentication service before attempting to relink the accounts.\n* The new authentication service is expected to be ready for use at the end of February.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The user has a custom domain set up with their Google account, which will be kept as their primary account.\n* The support representative reset the user's GitHub account to allow for another relink attempt.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* The user will wait for the new authentication service to be implemented before attempting to relink their accounts.\n* The user will be among the first to be staged for the new system once it's available.\n* The support representative will reset the user's GitHub account again before the next relink attempt.",
