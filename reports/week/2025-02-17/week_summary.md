## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving PiecesOS boot and launch issues:** These issues are the most frequent and impactful, affecting users across different operating systems. Focus on addressing root causes, such as hardware incompatibility and dependency errors.
- **Improve communication about hardware and software requirements:** Clearly communicate minimum system requirements for PiecesOS, especially CPU instruction set support (AVX2), to prevent installation and launch issues.
- **Enhance error messaging and troubleshooting documentation:** Provide more informative error messages to users, guiding them towards relevant solutions. Update documentation with detailed troubleshooting steps for common issues.
- **Investigate and address network connectivity problems:**  Diagnose the root causes of cloud service and local LLM connection issues. Provide clear instructions for users to verify network settings and firewall configurations.
- **Consider a more robust testing and release process:** Implement rigorous testing for new PiecesOS versions across different hardware and software configurations to identify potential issues before release.
- **Proactively monitor user feedback and support channels:** Regularly analyze support tickets, community forums, and other feedback channels to identify emerging issues and trends.
