## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving PiecesOS launch failures:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around PiecesOS failing to launch, particularly after the 11.1.1 update. Focus on addressing the root causes, such as AVX2 dependency and database errors, to prevent similar issues in future releases.
- **Improve communication about hardware/software requirements:** Clearly communicate any changes in hardware or software requirements to users before they upgrade to avoid compatibility issues. Provide detailed system requirements documentation and highlight potential compatibility issues with older hardware.
- **Develop a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for launch failures:** Create a dedicated section in the support documentation that specifically addresses PiecesOS launch failures. Include step-by-step instructions for common solutions, such as checking system requirements, updating to the latest version, and providing logs for debugging.
- **Enhance error messaging and logging:** Improve error messages to provide more specific information about the cause of the launch failure. Encourage users to submit detailed logs when reporting issues to aid in faster diagnosis and resolution.
- **Consider a more robust beta testing program:** Implement a more comprehensive beta testing program to identify and address potential issues before releasing new versions to the public. This will help minimize the impact of bugs and compatibility problems on users.
