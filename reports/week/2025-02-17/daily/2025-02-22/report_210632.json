However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance. Thanks!\n## Summary of the GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Rohanrathi99 reported an issue with their PiecesOS experiencing difficulties making requests to cloud and local models.\n* Mark, a support representative, identified possible network configuration issues causing communication disruptions with Pieces.\n* Rohan provided log files to further analyze the problem.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Pieces is unable to make requests to both the cloud and local model services.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark requested Rohan's logs for analysis. \n* Mark requested to schedule a call with Rohan to investigate the problem further.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Logs have been provided by the user and reviewed by the support representative, but no particular issues were identified.\n* A follow-up call was proposed to delve further into the problem.",
