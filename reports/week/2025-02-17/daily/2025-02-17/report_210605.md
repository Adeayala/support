## Common Issues
### 1. PiecesOS Launch Issues and Boot Failures
Users reported PiecesOS failing to launch or experiencing prolonged boot times, particularly after updates. This was attributed to factors like stricter hardware requirements (AVX2 support), data migration issues, and potential conflicts with OneDrive. Solutions included updating to the latest version (11.1.2), allowing sufficient time for data migration, reinstalling the app, and contacting support for persistent problems.

**Related Issues:**
- [#624](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/624): PiecesOS was unable to launch.
- [#620](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/620): Pieces os doesn't launch at all for past week. Can't use pieces at all

### 2. PiecesOS 11.1.1 launch failure due to AVX2 requirement
Users reported PiecesOS 11.1.1 crashing or failing to launch on macOS and Windows. The issue stemmed from a new dependency on CPUs supporting AVX2 instructions. This affected users with older CPUs. The Pieces team resolved the issue by releasing version 11.1.2, which removed the AVX2 requirement.

### 3. PiecesOS Launch Issues
Users report PiecesOS failing to launch, particularly version 11.1.1, due to stricter hardware requirements. This renders Pieces unusable for affected users.  Solutions include a patch (version 11.1.2) addressing the issue and users providing logs for further analysis.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolution of PiecesOS launch issues:** Focus on addressing the root causes of boot failures, AVX2 compatibility problems, and data migration issues to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Improve communication about hardware requirements:** Clearly communicate any changes in hardware requirements (e.g., AVX2 support) to users before and during updates to prevent unexpected launch issues.
- **Provide troubleshooting resources for common issues:** Create comprehensive documentation, FAQs, or knowledge base articles addressing common launch problems, including step-by-step solutions and workarounds.
- **Investigate and address OneDrive conflicts:** Further investigate the reported conflicts with OneDrive on Windows and implement permanent solutions to prevent similar issues in the future.
- **Monitor core dependencies and ensure stability:** Implement robust monitoring and testing for core dependencies to identify and address potential issues proactively, preventing boot-up and connection errors.
- **Gather detailed logs and system information:** Encourage users to provide detailed logs and system information when reporting issues to facilitate faster diagnosis and resolution.
- **Consider a more phased rollout for major updates:** Implement a phased rollout strategy for major updates, allowing for early detection and mitigation of issues before they impact a wider user base.
- **Improve error messaging and guidance:** Provide more user-friendly error messages that clearly explain the problem and suggest potential solutions or workarounds.
- **Enhance support for Linux users:** Allocate resources to investigate and address Linux-specific issues promptly, ensuring a consistent experience across all supported platforms.
- **Continuously monitor user feedback and iterate:** Establish a feedback loop to capture user experiences and identify recurring issues, allowing for continuous improvement of the support process and product stability.
