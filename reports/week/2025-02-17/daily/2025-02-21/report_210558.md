## Recommendations
- **Investigate and address PiecesOS login and connectivity issues:** This appears to be the most common problem reported by users. Prioritize finding the root cause and providing a solution.
- **Improve error messaging:** Vague messages like "Unable to sign in! We aren't sure what happened." are not helpful for users. Provide more specific information about the error and potential solutions.
- **Develop troubleshooting documentation:** Create comprehensive guides for common issues, including network configuration, log file analysis, and contacting support.
- **Consider firewall and network configurations:** As suggested by a support agent, these factors might contribute to connectivity problems. Provide guidance or automated checks to address them.
- **Enhance communication about ongoing issues:** Keep users informed about the progress of investigations and expected resolution times for known problems like the cloud service issues.
