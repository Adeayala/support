Suggested workarounds include reinstalling both Pieces OS and the conflicting service, ensuring the external service runs first, or waiting for Pieces OS updates with improved external service detection.",

          "text": "Pieces OS conflicting with Installed Ollama Server?\n### Software\n\nPieces OS\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nWindows\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\n11.0.3\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [ ] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\nMy Pieces OS instance's Ollama server would always give errors regarding various Cuda dll files not being registered or not found, so I then installed Ollama server from its source which works and Pieces OS could also connect too and use, the problem I'm facing now is that Pieces OS on startup seems to keep starting its own Ollama instance rather than using the externally installed Ollama server instance which means I see the Cuda dll errors again.  My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk is experiencing issues with Ollama on Pieces OS, specifically with Cuda12 dll errors.\n* Johnkennyuk uninstalled and reinstalled both Ollama and Pieces OS multiple times, but the issue persisted.\n* The issue seems to be related to Pieces OS attempting to start its own Ollama instance even though an external instance is already running.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Conflicting installations of Ollama leading to Cuda errors.\n* Pieces OS failing to detect the external Ollama instance.\n* Startup order potentially causing conflicts.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Brian-at-pieces suggested multiple uninstall and reinstall steps, including using the OllamaSetup.exe installer.\n* Johnkennyuk performed several uninstalls and path cleanups, leading to the issue resolving itself.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue seems to be resolved for now, but the root cause remains unclear.\n* Johnkennyuk is still concerned about the problem recurring and has proposed solutions for Pieces OS to detect and handle external Ollama instances.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation indicates that Johnkennyuk primarily uses Winget for installations and uninstalls.\n* Johnkennyuk has confirmed that the issue occurs specifically with Pieces OS's Ollama Server instances.\n* Johnkennyuk has provided screenshots of the error messages.\n\n\n**Overall, the issue appears to be resolved for now, but further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and prevent future occurrences.**",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Account Linking Problem\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User @johnkennyuk was experiencing issues linking their GitHub and Google accounts.\n* The current account linking flow was identified as outdated and not user-friendly.\n* A new account linking service is being developed and expected to be released by the end of February.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The existing account linking flow was not working properly.\n* There were inconsistencies in email capitalization between accounts, which might have been causing issues.\n* The old authentication service had limitations.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* A new account linking service is under development.\n* The user's Github account was reset multiple times to facilitate troubleshooting.\n* The user was advised to wait for the new system to be released.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The new account linking service is not yet available.\n* The user opted to wait for the new system instead of further troubleshooting.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new system is expected to be more robust and handle email capitalization inconsistencies.\n* The user can be one of the first to test the new system upon release.",
