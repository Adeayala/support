## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Integration Conflicts
Users report conflicts with Pieces OS's built-in services, like Ollama, and externally installed ones. This leads to errors, often related to dependencies like Cuda.  Suggested workarounds include reinstalling both Pieces OS and the conflicting service, ensuring the external service runs first, or waiting for Pieces OS updates with improved external service detection.
