My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* John Kenny (johnkennyuk) encountered issues with Ollama server on Pieces OS.\n* He experienced Cuda12 dll errors related to the `cublas64_12.dll` file.\n* John suspected a corrupted installation or startup order conflicts.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Multiple Ollama installations caused conflicts.\n* Incorrect startup order prevented Pieces OS from detecting external Ollama instance.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Uninstalling Ollama and Pieces OS, followed by a clean reinstall of Ollama and then Pieces OS.\n* Cleaning up PATH environment variables.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue initially resolved itself after multiple uninstalls and cleanups.\n* However, the problem reoccurred, likely due to the external Ollama instance starting before Pieces OS completed its startup.\n* A workaround involves disabling Pieces OS launch on sign in, but this is not ideal.\n\n**Open questions:**\n\n* Can Pieces OS detect and store information about external Ollama instances?\n* Is it possible to prevent Pieces OS from installing its bundled Ollama instance when an external one is detected?",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* @johnkennyuk is unable to link their Github and Google accounts with Pieces.\n* Existing linking flow is not working as intended.\n* New account linking system is under development with a planned release at the end of February.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* User has two separate accounts for Github and Google.\n* Accounts were previously registered with a capital letter discrepancy between emails.\n* Current authentication service has limitations for account linking.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark-at-pieces reset @johnkennyuk's Github account to attempt re-linking.\n* User requested to try linking again after clearing cookies.\n* Temporary disabling of email privacy setting from Github suggested.\n* New account linking system in development with improved capabilities.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Current linking attempt with Github login was unsuccessful.\n* User opted to wait for the new account linking system.\n* New system expected to be ready for production within the next few weeks.\n* Mark-at-pieces reset @johnkennyuk's Github account for future attempts.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Users will not be automatically migrated to the new system and can choose to use it when available.\n* Developer acknowledged the possibility of capitalization discrepancy being the root cause.\n* Issue was triaged and addressed promptly by the support team.\n* Mark-at-pieces offered additional assistance through calendar invites and email communication.",
