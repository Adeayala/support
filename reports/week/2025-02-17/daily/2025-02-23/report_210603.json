Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of Conversation:\n\n**Johnkennyuk** encountered an issue with account linking on Pieces app. They initiated a conversation with **pieces-support-bot** and **mark-at-pieces** provided assistance. \n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk encountered an issue where they were unable to link their Github and Google accounts.\n* The current account linking flow is known to be problematic and is planned to be replaced in mid-to-late February.\n* Johnkennyuk prefers to keep their custom domain on their Google account as the main account.\n* A minor inconsistency in email capitalization was identified as a potential cause of the issue.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The existing account linking flow is not straightforward and is known to be problematic.\n* A minor inconsistency in email capitalization was identified.\n* The Github account sign-in process might not be prompting the account linking flow as intended.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark-at-pieces proposed a manual merging of the accounts and offered to walk Johnkennyuk through the process.\n* They reset Johnkennyuk's Github account multiple times to troubleshoot the issue.\n* They suggested temporarily disabling the email privacy setting on the Github side.\n* Johnkennyuk suggested waiting for the new account linking system to be implemented.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The account linking issue remains unresolved.\n* Johnkennyuk is waiting for the new account linking system to be released and plans to retry the linking process then.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new account linking system is expected to be ready by the end of February.\n* It is unclear whether the email capitalization issue was the actual cause of the problem.\n* Johnkennyuk has expressed interest in being among the first users to test the new system.",

Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application.

My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User johnkennyuk encountered Cuda errors when running Ollama server within Pieces OS.\n* The errors were related to missing or conflicting Cuda DLLs.\n* Reinstalling Ollama and Pieces OS resolved the issue initially, but it reoccurred.\n* The problem seemed related to the startup order of Ollama and Pieces OS.\n* Disabling Pieces OS automatic launch on startup worked as a workaround.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Conflicting Cuda DLL installations between Ollama and Pieces OS.\n* Startup order issue causing Ollama to fail to launch within Pieces OS.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Reinstalling Ollama and Pieces OS.\n* Checking and cleaning the PATH environment variable.\n* Disabling Pieces OS automatic launch on startup.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is resolved for now, but the cause remains unclear.\n* User requests further investigation into preventing Pieces OS from launching its own Ollama instance if an external one is already running.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue appears to be specific to the user's setup and may not be widespread.\n* Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and a more permanent solution.",
