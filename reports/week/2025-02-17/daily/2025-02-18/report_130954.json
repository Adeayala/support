  "recommendations": [
    "**Investigate and address the PiecesOS startup freeze issue:** This is the most common issue reported, with users experiencing freezes at the \"ensure core dependency\" stage. Focus on resolving data migration conflicts, OneDrive interactions, and MacOS startup compatibility.",
    "**Improve communication around updates:** Provide clear instructions and information about potential issues or changes users might encounter after an update. This can include proactively warning about data migration times, OneDrive conflicts, and recommended steps to avoid startup issues.",
    "**Develop a more robust solution for MacOS startup issues:** While closing and reopening the app seems to work temporarily, a permanent fix is needed to address the underlying compatibility issue between PiecesOS and MacOS.",
    "**Monitor the effectiveness of updates:** Track the number of users still experiencing the startup freeze after each update to measure the effectiveness of the implemented solutions. Continue to investigate and address the issue until it is fully resolved for all users.",
    "**Gather more detailed logs and user feedback:** Encourage users to submit detailed logs and feedback when they encounter the startup freeze. This information can help pinpoint the root cause of the issue and develop more targeted solutions.",
    "**Consider a rollback option for problematic updates:** In cases where an update causes widespread issues, have a plan in place to quickly and efficiently roll back to a previous stable version. This can minimize user disruption and frustration while a permanent fix is developed.",
    "**Create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide:** Develop a detailed troubleshooting guide for common issues, including the PiecesOS startup freeze. This guide should be easily accessible to users through the PiecesOS website, help center, and support channels.",
    "**Proactively monitor system health and performance:** Implement monitoring tools and processes to detect potential issues before they become widespread. This can help identify and address emerging problems early on, reducing the impact on users and support operations."
