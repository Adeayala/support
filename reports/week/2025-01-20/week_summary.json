However, @mark-at-pieces pointed out that qdrant will be deprecated with the next PiecesOS release, making the issue irrelevant.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:** The issue will be closed as it's no longer relevant due to the upcoming qdrant deprecation. The documentation will likely be updated to reflect this change in the future.",
