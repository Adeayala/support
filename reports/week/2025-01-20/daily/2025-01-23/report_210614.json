Something went wrong with processing. Please wait a few seconds and try again.\"\n* The issues appear to be related to the Claude and Gemini language models, as switching to GPT-4o resolves the problem for some users.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Users are unable to use the Pieces applications due to the processing error.\n* The root cause of the error is unclear, but it seems to be related to the language models or SSL certificates.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Update to Pieces version 11.0.3.\n* Sign in to Pieces to increase the rate limit.\n* Switch to the GPT-4o language model.\n* Remove the OpenAI API key (although this is currently not recommended).\n* Reinstall PiecesOS and Pieces for Developers applications.\n* Ensure Windows Defender is not blocking Pieces requests.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is still being investigated, and the exact cause remains unknown.\n* Some users have found workarounds by switching to GPT-4o or removing their OpenAI API key.\n* The developers are actively looking into the problem and providing support to users experiencing the issue.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue appears to have started around December 28, 2024.\n* There are currently no permanent solutions available, but the developers are working on resolving the problem.\n* Users experiencing the issue can contact the developers for further assistance.",
