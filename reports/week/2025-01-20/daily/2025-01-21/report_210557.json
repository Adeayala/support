  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize CARA language support:** Given the user request and its potential impact on a Windows-based ERP system, prioritize evaluating and potentially adding CARA language support to Pieces.",
    "**Improve documentation for adding new languages:**  Provide clear and detailed documentation on the process and requirements for adding new languages to Pieces. This will help users understand the feasibility of supporting their specific language and potentially contribute to the process.",
    "**Gather more information about CARA:** Reach out to the user who requested CARA support to gather more information about the language, its syntax, common use cases, and any existing tooling or resources. This will help in assessing the effort required for integration.",
    "**Consider a public roadmap for language support:**  Maintain a public roadmap or feature request tracker to provide transparency on planned language support and allow users to upvote or provide feedback on desired languages.",
    "**Investigate automated language support detection:** Explore options for automatically detecting and suggesting language support based on user projects or code snippets. This can help streamline the onboarding process for users working with less common languages."
