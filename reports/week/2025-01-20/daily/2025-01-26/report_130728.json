          "text": "PiecesOS using too much RAM/spike in CPU\nSeveral users have called in recently about Pieces using too much RAM or causing a spike in CPU up to 100%. We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation \n\n**Problem:**\n- PiecesOS, a local server for the Pieces product suite, is experiencing high RAM and CPU usage for many users.\n- The issue is particularly prevalent when running on macOS and Windows machines.\n- Some users report memory leaks and CPU usage exceeding 2-3GB, causing performance issues.\n\n**Potential Causes:**\n- **Live Context** feature, which keeps track of user actions and data for prediction, contributes to high resource usage.\n- On-device machine learning (ML) processing requires significant resources.\n- Potential memory leaks and bugs may be contributing factors.\n\n**Solutions Discussed:**\n- **Live Context:** Turning off Live Context can significantly reduce RAM consumption.\n- **Optimize Memory option:** Clicking the Pieces \"P\" icon and selecting \"Optimize Memory\" helps unload unused ML models, freeing up RAM.\n- **Monitoring and investigation:** The Pieces team is actively monitoring the issue to identify and resolve potential memory leaks and optimize resource usage.\n- **Future improvements:** Continuous development is underway to improve performance and reduce resource requirements.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- The problem persists, particularly for users running on macOS/Windows and with Live Context enabled.\n- The Pieces team is actively working on solutions and acknowledges the need for performance improvements.\n- Users with high RAM/CPU usage are encouraged to contact the Pieces team for further troubleshooting and assistance.",
