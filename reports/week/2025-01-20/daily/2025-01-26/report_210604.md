## Recommendations
- **Investigate and address the root cause of high resource usage in PiecesOS.** This is the most pressing issue, impacting many users and potentially leading to churn.  Allocate development resources to identify and fix the memory leak or other factors causing high RAM/CPU consumption.
- **Improve communication about ongoing issues.**  Acknowledge the high resource usage issue publicly and provide regular updates on the progress of the investigation and fix.  This can help manage user expectations and reduce support tickets related to this issue.
- **Develop more detailed troubleshooting documentation for connection issues.**  Provide step-by-step instructions for common solutions, such as restarting PiecesOS and disabling long-term memory.  This can empower users to resolve issues independently and reduce the load on support agents.
- **Consider prioritizing bug fixes and performance improvements over new feature development.**  Addressing existing issues will lead to a more stable and enjoyable user experience, which can increase user satisfaction and retention in the long run.
