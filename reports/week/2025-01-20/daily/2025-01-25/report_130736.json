The message lacks clarity and prevents interaction with the app. Restarting the computer appears to be the only workaround. The issue may stem from communication problems between Pieces components like ThemePark and Pieces Core Services.",

Sometimes, (possibly after a background update?), this dialog appears on my desktop. I don't know what it means, exactly, but I cannot click \"Ok\" and there is no other way to dismiss it. My only option appears to be to restart the computer, which is often impractical.
