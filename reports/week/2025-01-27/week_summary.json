          "text": "PiecesOS using too much RAM/spike in CPU\nSeveral users have called in recently about Pieces using too much RAM or causing a spike in CPU up to 100%. We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation Regarding High Memory and CPU Usage in PiecesOS:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* High memory and CPU usage by PiecesOS, impacting user experience.\n* Some users reporting excessive RAM usage (up to 5GB) and high CPU spikes (120%+).\n* Speculation that Live Context feature might contribute to high resource usage.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Memory leaks leading to excessive RAM consumption.\n* High CPU usage causing system slowdowns and impacting overall performance.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Database technology replacement in PiecesOS 11.1.0 to address memory and CPU issues.\n* Optimize Memory feature to temporarily unload ML models and free up RAM.\n* Live Context deactivation as a potential solution to reduce memory consumption.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* PiecesOS 11.1.0 release addressing memory and CPU issues is available.\n* Community feedback is being collected to assess the effectiveness of the release.\n* Further improvements are planned to optimize resource usage.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Some users continue to experience high CPU usage even after updating to 11.1.0.\n* Live Context is suspected to be a potential factor in high memory consumption.\n* The development team is actively working on further optimizations.",
