          "text": "PiecesOS using too much RAM/spike in CPU\nSeveral users have called in recently about Pieces using too much RAM or causing a spike in CPU up to 100%. We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of PiecesOS RAM and CPU issues:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* PiecesOS consumes high RAM, sometimes exceeding 5GB, even when not actively used.\n* High CPU usage spikes to 120% or more, slowing down the system.\n* Running PiecesOS in the background significantly impacts RAM and CPU performance.\n\n**Identified Problems:**\n\n* A memory leak with unknown cause leads to excessive RAM usage.\n* High CPU usage spikes cause system slowdowns, despite no identifiable triggers.\n* Using Live Context feature adds to RAM consumption due to its data processing demands.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* PiecesOS 11.1.0 release replaces heavy database technologies to address memory and CPU issues.\n* Option to optimize memory usage in the PiecesOS interface.\n* Turning off Live Context to reduce RAM consumption.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The 11.1.0 release aims to improve CPU usage and reduce memory consumption.\n* Further fixes are planned for future releases.\n* Users are encouraged to update to 11.1.0 and report their experiences.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The issue seems ongoing, with reports continuing in 2025.\n* RAM consumption of around 2GB is considered standard, though developers are actively working on reducing it.\n* Users can schedule a call with the Pieces team to troubleshoot individual issues.",
