We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## High Memory and CPU Usage in Pieces OS: Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* High RAM usage of PiecesOS, reaching up to 5GB or more, with reports of background mining.\n* Significant CPU spikes, sometimes exceeding 50%, impacting system performance.\n* Issues triggered even when PiecesOS is running in the background and with no models actively running.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Memory leak causing excessive RAM consumption.\n* Underlying database technology potentially contributing to resource usage.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Memory optimization feature implemented (reduces 1GB of RAM usage).\n* Replacement of heavy database technologies in PiecesOS 11.1.0 to address CPU and memory concerns.\n* Further performance improvements planned for future releases.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* PiecesOS 11.1.0 released to address memory and CPU issues.\n* Users are encouraged to upgrade and report their experience with the new version.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Live Context feature, crucial for Pieces' functionality, contributes to resource consumption.\n* Turning off Live Context can reduce RAM usage.\n* Users reporting issues exceeding 2GB RAM or experiencing significant CPU spikes are encouraged to contact Pieces for further assistance.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nWhile Pieces acknowledges the resource consumption issues and actively works to improve performance, users may still experience high memory and CPU usage with specific configurations or heavy workloads.
