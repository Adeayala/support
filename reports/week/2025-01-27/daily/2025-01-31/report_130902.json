  "recommendations": [
    "**Encourage Detailed Issue Reporting:** Implement measures to guide users in providing specific details about their problems. This could involve updating the issue submission template with clear instructions and examples, or using interactive prompts during the submission process.",
    "**Improve Ticket Triage:** While automated triage can be helpful, ensure human oversight to categorize tickets accurately, especially when initial descriptions are vague. This will help direct tickets to the appropriate team members faster.",
    "**Proactive Communication:**  If a ticket lacks sufficient detail, proactively reach out to the user for clarification. This demonstrates responsiveness and can expedite the troubleshooting process.",
    "**Enhance Support Bot Interaction:** Explore ways to make the support bot more effective in gathering information. For instance, it could ask follow-up questions based on initial input to prompt users for more details.",
    "**Knowledge Base Expansion:** Develop and maintain a comprehensive knowledge base with articles and FAQs addressing common issues. This can empower users to self-serve and potentially reduce ticket volume.",
    "**Feedback Mechanisms:** Regularly solicit feedback from users about their support experiences. This can provide valuable insights into areas for improvement and highlight recurring pain points."
