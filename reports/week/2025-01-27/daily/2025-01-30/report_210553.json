  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolving installation and launching issues:** The most frequent support tickets are related to difficulties installing and launching Pieces OS and the desktop app. Focusing on resolving these issues should be a top priority.",
    "**Improve communication around updates:** The \"Non-dismissable overlay message\" suggests users are unclear about updates or encounter issues after updates. Improving communication about updates and ensuring a smooth update process can reduce user frustration.",
    "**Investigate dependency issues:**  The mention of \"checking for dependency issues\" suggests potential conflicts or missing dependencies are causing problems.  Thoroughly testing and documenting dependencies can prevent these issues.",
    "**Provide clear and concise error messages:** Error messages should be easily understandable and provide actionable steps for users to resolve the issue. Vague error messages contribute to user frustration and increase support tickets.",
    "**Develop a comprehensive troubleshooting guide:** Create a detailed troubleshooting guide addressing common installation, launching, and update issues. This resource can empower users to resolve problems independently and reduce the load on the support team.",
    "**Consider platform-specific solutions:** Issues seem more prevalent on Windows. Investigate platform-specific solutions or optimizations to improve the user experience on different operating systems.",
    "**Gather more data on \"Ollama failed to install\" errors:** Ticket #605, with the highest activity, suggests issues with Ollama installation. Gather more data on this specific error to understand its root cause and implement a fix.",
    "**Continuously monitor and analyze support tickets:** Regularly analyze support ticket data to identify trends, common issues, and areas for improvement. This data-driven approach ensures support operations remain effective and efficient over time."
