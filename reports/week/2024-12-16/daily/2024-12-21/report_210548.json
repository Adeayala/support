    "**Prioritize Windows Stability:** Allocate additional resources to address the high frequency of \"PiecesOS Windows Stability Issues.\" This could involve dedicated QA for Windows builds, deeper investigation into OS-specific interactions, and proactive communication with affected users.",
    "**Improve Installation Experience:** Investigate and resolve the root causes behind installation errors like \"Type ContextFacade is already registered.\" Enhance installation guides and troubleshooting documentation to empower users to self-resolve common issues.",
    "**Enhance LTM Engine Reliability:** Address the LTM Engine malfunctions reported by users. This may involve code reviews, regression testing, and potentially a dedicated communication to users about the issue and its resolution.",
    "**Monitor and Address App Resizing Issues:** While less frequent, the resizing issue on macOS highlights the importance of ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Implement robust testing for different operating systems and screen sizes.",
