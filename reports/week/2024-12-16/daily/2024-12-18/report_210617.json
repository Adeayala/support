Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.\n\nAs each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.\n\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n\nYou haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.\n\nUpon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?\n\nThroughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.\n\nThere's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?\n\nFor example:\n\n3   4\n4   3\n2   5\n1   3\n3   9\n3   3\nMaybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.\n\nWithin each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.\n\nIn the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:\n\nThe smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.\nThe second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.\nThe third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.\nThe next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.\nThe fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.\nFinally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.\nTo find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!\n\nYour actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?\n```\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* An issue was reported where the Pieces Copilot module was throwing an error (\"`stream is closed`\").\n* This error occurred inconsistently and seemed to be related to using the Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM.\n* The error was seen by multiple users (@mark-at-pieces, @sam-at-pieces, and @hra42).\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The root cause of the error was unclear.\n* The error message was misleading and did not provide useful information for troubleshooting.\n* The error appeared to be related to an empty prediction returned by the LLM.\n* This could be caused by several factors, including harmful content detection, internal errors on the Google side, service unavailability, or incorrect parameters.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Investigate the cause of the empty predictions from the LLM.\n* Change the error message to be more informative and suggest potential solutions to the user.\n* Update the Pieces Copilot module to surface errors from the AOT side.\n* Implement retry logic for handling errors related to empty predictions.\n* A potential fix was included in the latest release of os server (11.0.0).\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The root cause of the error has been identified as empty predictions returned by the LLM.\n* A fix has been implemented in the latest release of os server.\n* Users are encouraged to update to the latest version to see if the issue is resolved.\n* Further investigation will be conducted to determine if a more permanent solution is needed.\n* The error message will be updated to provide more information and suggest potential solutions to the user.",

Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Conversation Summary:\n\n**Key Point:** Issues with importing LLMs and local models in Pieces app.\n\n**Problem:**\n\n* Users cannot import LLM models downloaded manually.\n* Downloaded models fail to work (e.g., mistral-7b model).\n* Ollama installation fails.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n* For failed downloads:\n    * Shutdown Pieces.\n    * Add an empty \"download_success.txt\" to the specified directory.\n    * Restart Pieces.\n* Utilize manually downloaded Ollama model: https://ollama.com/download/linux\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* Solutions provided for failed downloads and Ollama installation.\n* Further investigation into root cause of issues ongoing.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n* Users can utilize manually downloaded Ollama models.\n* A new issue has been opened (#537) to investigate the failure to install Ollama.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* A new Pieces release was mentioned that may resolve the issues automatically.\n* User reported that the mistral-7b model malfunctioned. This issue might require further investigation.",
