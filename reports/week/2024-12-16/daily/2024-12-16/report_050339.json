          "text": "Manually downloading a LLM\n### Software\n\nDesktop Application\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nLinux\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\nLatest\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [ ] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\nI am attempting to install Pieces with a local LLM. Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User (@ekuznetsov139) reports an issue with importing a model they downloaded manually.\n* @hra42 suggests that manual downloads won't work due to how Pieces integrates the model.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Manual model download doesn't seem to be compatible with Pieces integration.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* @pieces-support-bot suggests related issues and resources for troubleshooting.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Issue has been triaged and routed to the Pieces team. \n* User advised to wait for a follow-up within 24 hours.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* Existing Issues: https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues\n* Documentation: https://docs.pieces.app\n* YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@getpieces",

    "**Improve manual LLM download process:** Investigate why manual downloads are problematic and consider officially supporting them. Provide clear instructions and troubleshooting steps for users experiencing download interruptions or unrecognized file issues.",
    "**Optimize download manager:** Implement a more robust download manager that supports resuming interrupted downloads and handles unstable connections better.",
    "**Enhance model recognition:** Improve the app's ability to recognize manually downloaded LLMs to avoid truncation and redownloads.",
    "**Update documentation:** Clearly state whether manual LLM downloads are supported and, if so, provide detailed instructions. If not, explain the reasons and guide users on the recommended approach.",
    "**Consider smaller model downloads:** Explore the feasibility of allowing users to download smaller model components to mitigate issues with unstable connections.",
    "**Monitor and address common issues:**  Continue tracking common issues like those reported with manual LLM downloads and prioritize solutions based on their frequency and impact on users.",
    "**Provide proactive support:**  Given the known issue with manual downloads, consider reaching out to users who mention attempting this in their support requests to offer guidance and potential workarounds."
