Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Importing a Manually Downloaded Model\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (@ekuznetsov139) is unable to import a model they downloaded manually.\n* Pieces support bot recommends checking related issues and resources.\n* Brian from Pieces explains the issue and provides a temporary workaround.\n* A new release with improved LLM infrastructure is expected soon.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Can't import a manually downloaded model.\n* Partial download corruption makes successful import impossible.\n* Previous workaround (updating db property) is insufficient.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* **Temporary:**\n    * Shutdown Pieces.\n    * Add an empty \"download_success.txt\" file to the specified directory.\n    * Restart Pieces.\n* **Long-term:**\n    * New release with improved LLM infrastructure, including the ability to resume failed downloads.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Temporary workaround provided.\n* New release expected soon with a permanent fix.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new release will address this issue comprehensively.\n* Users are encouraged to wait for the new release for the best experience.",

This highlights the need for careful consideration of potential impacts before implementing such changes.\n* The developer's responsiveness and willingness to provide individual solutions to affected users is commendable.",
