| [#527](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/527) | Manually downloading a LLM | 5.68 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Local LLM Download Issues in Pieces
Users are experiencing difficulties downloading large LLMs locally within the Pieces application, particularly due to unstable network connections. Manual downloads are not recognized by the system, and the application repeatedly restarts downloads, hindering progress. Potential solutions involve improving download management, allowing for paused and resumed downloads, and implementing a mechanism to integrate manually downloaded models.

## Recommendations
- **Improve download management:** Investigate and address the issues related to unstable network connections causing interruptions in LLM downloads. Implement features like pausing and resuming downloads to provide a more robust download experience.
- **Allow manual LLM integration:** Develop a mechanism for users to manually download LLM files and integrate them into the Pieces application. This will empower users with limited network connectivity and provide a workaround for download issues.
- **Enhance communication around manual downloads:** If manual LLM integration is not feasible, clearly communicate this limitation to users. Provide guidance on alternative solutions or workarounds.
- **Monitor and address Pieces download restarts:** Investigate why the application restarts downloads from the beginning even after a manual download. Implement checks to recognize partially downloaded files and resume from the point of interruption.
- **Improve model recognition and integration:** Address the issue where manually placed LLM files are not recognized by the system. Ensure the application properly detects and integrates models downloaded through alternative methods.
