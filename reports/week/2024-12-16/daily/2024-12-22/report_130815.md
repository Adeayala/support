## Common Issues
### 1. VS Code Extension Fails to Connect to Pieces OS in Dev Container
Users are experiencing issues connecting the VS Code Pieces extension to Pieces OS when running inside a Docker container. The extension struggles to automatically detect and connect to the Pieces OS instance. As a workaround, manually setting the 'custom url' in the extension settings to 'http://host.docker.internal:1000' has been successful. Future improvements aim to automate this connection process and enhance documentation for remote environment setups.
