## Common Issues
### 1. VS Code Dev Container Connectivity to Pieces OS
Users experience connectivity issues between VS Code Dev Containers and the Pieces OS instance on their host machine. This occurs because the extension assumes Pieces OS is not in a container if DNS resolution fails. A temporary workaround involves setting the 'custom url' to 'http://host.docker.internal:1000'. Future updates aim to automatically detect cloud-based Pieces OS instances, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

## Recommendations
- **Improve Dev Container Connectivity:** Investigate and implement a more robust solution for seamless connectivity between VS Code Dev Containers and Pieces OS, including automatic detection of cloud-based instances. This will address the common issue of connectivity problems and eliminate the need for workarounds.
- **Enhance Documentation:** Provide clear and detailed documentation on configuring VS Code Dev Containers to work with Pieces OS, specifically addressing port forwarding for cloud environments. This will empower users to resolve connectivity issues independently.
- **Consider In-App Guidance:** Explore incorporating in-app guidance or tooltips within the VS Code extension to assist users experiencing connectivity issues. This could include automatically detecting remote environments and suggesting relevant troubleshooting steps or documentation.
- **Monitor and Analyze Common Issues:** Continue monitoring support tickets and identifying common issues to proactively address them. This includes analyzing the frequency and impact of issues to prioritize development efforts.
- **Gather User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users on their support experiences, particularly regarding Dev Container connectivity. This can be achieved through surveys, in-app prompts, or community forums. Use this feedback to further improve documentation, in-app guidance, and future development decisions.
