## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS: Users encounter errors using GPT models
Users are experiencing errors and "Something went wrong" messages when attempting to use GPT models within the Pieces OS desktop application. The issue appears to be related to rate limiting and potential bugs in the Long Term Memory (LTM) engine. Temporary solutions include contacting support for rate limit increases and restarting the application. A permanent fix involving user authentication for cloud processing is expected in a future release.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize bug fixes related to GPT model errors and LTM engine issues within the Pieces OS desktop application.** The most frequent support tickets indicate these are major pain points for users.
- **Improve communication around rate limiting.** Provide clearer error messages and explore options for user-controlled rate limit increases or authentication for cloud processing.
- **Create documentation or FAQs addressing common issues.** This should include workarounds for manually downloading LLMs, enabling the LTM engine, and troubleshooting GPT model errors.
- **Investigate and address the app crashes reported by users, particularly when uploading files.** This may require further debugging and testing to reproduce and fix the issue.
- **Consider implementing a more robust download manager for LLM models.** Allow for resuming interrupted downloads to improve user experience, especially for those with unstable connections.
