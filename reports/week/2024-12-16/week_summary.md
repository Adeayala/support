## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces app fails to recognize manually downloaded LLMs
Users are experiencing issues with the Pieces app not recognizing manually downloaded LLMs due to unstable network connections. The app attempts to download the entire model at once, causing failures and restarts. Manually downloading and placing the model in the designated location doesn't resolve the issue, as the app still initiates a fresh download. Editing the models.db file to reflect the download status has also proven ineffective.

## Recommendations
- Investigate why the Pieces app fails to recognize manually downloaded LLMs, especially in cases of unstable network connections.
- Improve the Pieces app's download manager to handle interruptions and resume downloads seamlessly.
- Update the Pieces app's documentation to include a clear step-by-step guide on manually downloading and installing LLMs.
- Consider implementing a feature allowing users to specify the download location for LLMs within the Pieces app.
