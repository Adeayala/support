Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub conversation about importing downloaded models into Pieces\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* Importing manually downloaded models isn't currently supported due to potential corruption issues and integration challenges.\n* Pieces automatically deletes partially downloaded models due to uncertainty about their integrity.\n* A workaround involving adding an \"download_success.txt\" file and restarting might work until a permanent solution is available.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Manually imported models might be corrupted.\n* Partial downloads get deleted, making completion difficult.\n\n**Proposed/implemented solutions:**\n\n* A new release with improved on-device LLM infrastructure, including the ability to resume failed downloads, is coming soon.\n* A temporary workaround involving adding a file and restarting is provided.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue of importing downloaded models remains unresolved, but a fix is expected in the pr\u00f3ximos d\u00edas.\n* Users can try the workaround in the meantime.",
