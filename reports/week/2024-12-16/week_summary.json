      "description": "Users are experiencing issues with the Pieces app not recognizing manually downloaded LLMs due to unstable network connections. The app attempts to download the entire model at once, causing failures and restarts. Manually downloading and placing the model in the designated location doesn't resolve the issue, as the app still initiates a fresh download. Editing the models.db file to reflect the download status has also proven ineffective.",

Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User (@ekuznetsov139) encountered an issue when trying to import a manually downloaded LLM into Pieces app.\n* The problem is likely related to the way Pieces handles downloaded models and the integration process.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Inability to import manually downloaded models.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* No solutions explicitly proposed, but the author suggested consulting with @mark-at-pieces for further assistance.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Pieces Support Bot responded and triaged the issue to the relevant team.\n* User is advised to wait for a follow-up within 24 hours.\n* User provided with links to related issues, resources, and documentation.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* This issue seems related to previous reported problems with downloading and processing LLMs in the Pieces app.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe user reported an issue that requires further investigation by the Pieces team. No immediate solutions have been implemented, but the user will receive a follow-up within 24 hours.",
