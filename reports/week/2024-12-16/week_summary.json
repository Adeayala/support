Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User is unable to import a downloaded LLM model.\n* Pieces automatically deletes partially downloaded models due to potential corruption.\n* New infrastructure will include the ability to restart failed downloads.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Unable to import manually downloaded models.\n* Partial downloads are deleted, requiring full download again.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Check directory structure and add \"download_success.txt\" file.\n* Wait for new release with improved download infrastructure.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Issue is not yet resolved, but a new release with a fix is expected.\n* User is advised to wait for the new release.",

Although a call with the developer was mentioned as an option, the latest communication emphasizes using the email option instead.",
