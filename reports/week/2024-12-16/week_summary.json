Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- User is unable to import a manually downloaded LLLM model into Pieces.\n- Downloading incomplete or corrupted models leads to complete model deletion.\n- A new release will address the issue by allowing download restarts.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n- Unable to import manually downloaded models.\n- Issue with resuming incomplete or corrupted downloads.\n- Inconvenience caused by deleting incomplete downloads.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n- Add an empty \"download_success.txt\" file to the mistral directory.\n- Restart Pieces.\n- Upcoming release will allow download restarts.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n- Proposed workaround available.\n- Permanent solution awaiting release.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The user was advised to wait for the upcoming release for a permanent solution.\n- Related issues provided for reference.",
