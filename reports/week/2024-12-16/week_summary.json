Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Importing a manually downloaded model is currently not supported.\n* Pieces performs internal processing on downloaded models before they can be used.\n* A failed download will trigger a complete model deletion for data integrity.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Users cannot utilize manually downloaded models.\n* Incomplete downloads due to connection problems lead to the loss of the entire model file.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Adding an empty \"download_success.txt\" file in the specified directory and restarting Pieces might resolve the current issue (temporary workaround).\n* A new upcoming release will overhaul Pieces' on-device LLM infrastructure:\n    * Enabling restarting of incomplete downloads.\n    * Improving overall download handling and management.  \n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n- Temporary fix available.\n- Major update with enhanced download features and fixes expected soon.\n\n\nThis conversation indicates ongoing development in Pieces regarding handling LLM models and download management. Users experiencing the \"unable to import\" issue may consider the workaround or await the forthcoming update for a permanent solution.",
