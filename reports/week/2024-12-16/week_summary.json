Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## GitHub Issue Summary: Importing Downloaded Model\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User (@ekuznetsov139) encountered an issue where they couldn't import a manually downloaded LLM model.\n* Pieces support bot triaged the issue and suggested relevant resources.\n* Brian from Pieces (@brian-at-pieces) explained the reason for model deletion on failed downloads and proposed a workaround involving adding an empty file and restarting Pieces.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Manual model import was not possible due to the way Pieces integrates models.\n* Partial downloads were deleted on failure, making resuming downloads impossible.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Workaround involving adding an empty file to the mistral directory and restarting Pieces.\n* Upcoming release with overhauled LLM infrastructure, including the ability to resume failed downloads.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User can try the workaround while waiting for the upcoming release.\n* The upcoming release will address the issue permanently.",

Minutes ago it prompt me to update Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers. After the update both Vscode and PHPStorm plugins stopped working.\n\nPHPStorm says - It looks like port 1000 is occupied by another application. Pieces OS uses this port to communicate with plugins. Please, enable Pieces OS to run on port 1000.\n\nAnd Vscode says - Please update the Pieces for VS Code extension to the latest version. This version is only compatible with Pieces OS versions less than 11.0.0, and  you have 11.0.0 installed. But there isn't any Vscode plugin update.\n\nCan you help?
