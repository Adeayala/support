Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (@ekuznetsov139) reported an issue with importing a manually downloaded LLM model.\n* hra42 suggests the problem lies in Pieces' integration process, not just the raw model download.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Pieces deletes partially downloaded models due to potential corruption.\n* User's attempt to update the database property wasn't enough to resolve the issue.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* **Temporary workaround:**\n    1. Shutdown Pieces.\n    2. Add an empty \"download_success.txt\" file to the specified directory.\n    3. Restart Pieces.\n* **Long-term solution:**\n    - Upcoming Pieces release will overhaul the LLM infrastructure, enabling restarting failed downloads.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The user can try the temporary workaround until the new release with the improved infrastructure is available.\n* The new release is expected within the next day or two.\n* The issue will be resolved with the new release's ability to resume interrupted downloads.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user was provided with links to relevant resources, including existing issues, documentation, and the Pieces YouTube channel.",
