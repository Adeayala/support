Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.\n\nAs each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.\n\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n\nYou haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.\n\nUpon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?\n\nThroughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.\n\nThere's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?\n\nFor example:\n\n3   4\n4   3\n2   5\n1   3\n3   9\n3   3\nMaybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.\n\nWithin each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.\n\nIn the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:\n\nThe smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.\nThe second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.\nThe third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.\nThe next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.\nThe fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.\nFinally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.\nTo find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!\n\nYour actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?\n```\n## GitHub Issue Summary:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Infrequent issue occurring where API requests fail with an empty prediction and 200 status code.\n* Occurs with Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM.\n* Most likely caused by suppressed error on Vertex AI side.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Empty prediction received despite expecting an error code.\n* Unclear cause of the issue due to suppressed error.\n\n**Proposed/Implemented Solutions:**\n\n* Change error message to reflect the actual cause and prompt users to switch models or retry.\n* Investigate Vertex AI side for potential error suppression.\n* Update to os server version 11.0.0 which potentially includes a fix.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Potential fix implemented in os server version 11.0.0.\n* Further testing and confirmation needed to determine if the issue is resolved.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The issue may be related to harmful content detection, internal errors on Google side, service unavailability, or incorrect parameters.\n* A contact person at GCP is available to assist with further investigation.",

Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation about Importing Local LLM Models\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User (@ekuznetsov139) reported issues with importing downloaded LLM models manually.\n* Pieces support bot offered related issues and resources.\n* Pieces team member confirmed a bug affecting the download process and suggested a temporary solution involving adding a \"download_success.txt\" file.\n* A new release was announced to address the download issue permanently.\n* User reported further issues with the downloaded model (Mistral-7B) crashing the app and Pieces failing to install Ollama.\n* Pieces team member created a new issue for the Ollama installation problem and suggested a workaround involving downloading Ollama manually.\n\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n1. Manual LLM model import failed due to inability to verify integrity of partially downloaded files.\n2. Downloaded model (Mistral-7B) caused app crashes and high resource usage.\n3. Ollama installation failed within Pieces.\n\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n1. Add \"download_success.txt\" file to the directory to enable model usage.\n2. Announced a new release with improved download functionality and bug fixes.\n3. Suggested manual download of Ollama as a workaround.\n\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The team is investigating the Ollama installation issue.\n* User can utilize the downloaded LLM model by adding the \"download_success.txt\" file.\n\n\n**Note:** Information about the new release and its capabilities was provided as of December 2024.
