We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: High RAM Usage in PiecesOS\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* High RAM usage in PiecesOS, ranging from 2GB to 5GB, even when not actively using the application.\n* Some users experiencing high CPU usage alongside high RAM usage.\n* Memory usage sometimes increases after clicking \"Optimize Memory Usage\" button.\n* Users suspecting the software is mining cryptocurrency.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Memory leak in PiecesOS leading to high RAM usage.\n* High CPU usage potentially due to the same issue.\n* Ineffective \"Optimize Memory Usage\" function.\n* User concerns about potential unauthorized mining activities.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Pieces team is working on improving memory performance and addressing the memory leak.\n* \"Optimize Memory Usage\" function added to unload some ML models and free up RAM.\n* Team offering one-on-one calls to diagnose individual cases of high RAM/CPU usage.\n* Explanation provided that high resource usage is due to on-device ML capabilities.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Issue acknowledged by the Pieces team and actively being addressed.\n* Memory usage around 2GB considered normal currently.\n* Some users still experiencing high RAM/CPU usage, waiting for further improvements.\n* No evidence of unauthorized mining activities confirmed.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Live Context feature, powered by the Workstream Pattern Engine, contributes to increased resource usage.\n* Turning off Live Context may help reduce RAM consumption.\n* Pieces team encourages users experiencing high resource usage to contact them for further assistance.",

Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.\n\nAs each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.\n\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n\nYou haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.\n\nUpon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?\n\nThroughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.\n\nThere's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?\n\nFor example:\n\n3   4\n4   3\n2   5\n1   3\n3   9\n3   3\nMaybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.\n\nWithin each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.\n\nIn the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:\n\nThe smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.\nThe second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.\nThe third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.\nThe next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.\nThe fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.\nFinally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.\nTo find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!\n\nYour actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?\n```\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* The issue involves an error message received during model prediction.\n* The error occurs infrequently but affects several users, including @mark-at-pieces, @hra42, and @sam-at-pieces.\n* The issue appears to be specific to the Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The root cause of the error is unclear.\n* Initial analysis suggests the error may be due to various factors, including:\n    - Harmful content detection (possibly with false positives).\n    - Internal error on Google's side.\n    - Service unavailability.\n    - Incorrect parameters passed to the LLM.\n    - Oversized message content.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Sam proposes changing the error message to be more informative and suggest possible solutions, such as changing models or retrying the request.\n* A potential fix for the issue was included in the latest release of OS server (11.0.0).\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is still being investigated, but an update to OS server may have resolved the problem.\n* Further testing and confirmation are needed.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* @hra42 plans to discuss the issue with Google Vertex AI on Monday.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Update to OS server 11.0.0 and monitor for the error.\n* If the error persists, provide additional information to the issue, including steps to reproduce and logs.",
