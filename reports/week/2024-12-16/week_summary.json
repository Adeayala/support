Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.\n\nAs each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.\n\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n\nYou haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.\n\nUpon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?\n\nThroughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.\n\nThere's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?\n\nFor example:\n\n3   4\n4   3\n2   5\n1   3\n3   9\n3   3\nMaybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.\n\nWithin each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.\n\nIn the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:\n\nThe smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.\nThe second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.\nThe third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.\nThe next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.\nThe fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.\nFinally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.\nTo find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!\n\nYour actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?\n```\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The issue involves an infrequent error in the Pieces application where the user receives an empty response from the LLM.\n* The error is believed to be related to a suppressed error on the Vertex AI side, potentially due to harmful content detection, internal errors, service unavailability, or incorrect parameters.\n* Investigation ruled out issues with input length.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The error message provided is misleading as it does not reflect the true cause of the problem.\n* The error occurs infrequently, making it difficult to reproduce and diagnose.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Change the error message to be more informative and suggest potential solutions for the user, such as switching models or retrying the request.\n* Investigate and address the root cause of the error on the Vertex AI side.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* A potential fix for the issue has been implemented in the latest release of the server. \n* Further testing is needed to confirm if the fix resolves the problem.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user @hra42 offered to contact their GCP contact person for further assistance.\n* An image was attached to the conversation but its content was not relevant to the summary.",

Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* User (ekuznetsov139) reported issues importing a manually downloaded model into Pieces.\n* Pieces support bot provided resources and suggested restarting Pieces after adding a specific file.\n* User managed to install Mistral-7B but encountered crashes and no GPU usage.\n* Later, user reported issues with downloading and installing Ollama.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Downloaded models couldn't be imported.\n* Local Mistral-7B caused crashes and 0% GPU usage.\n* Ollama installation failed.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Solution for Mistral-7B installation was provided, but the model still caused crashes.\n* User was advised to download Ollama manually and Pieces should utilize it.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* User is experiencing issues with both locally downloaded models and Ollama installation.\n* A new issue is created for Ollama installation failure.\n* Support team is investigating the remaining issue.",
