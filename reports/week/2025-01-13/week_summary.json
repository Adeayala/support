The browser console logs numerous \"ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\" errors pointing to \"http://127.0.0.1:1000/.well-known/health\". Disabling the extension resolves the issue. This pattern suggests the extension repeatedly attempts to connect to a local service on port 1000 that is either unresponsive or inaccessible.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Investigate and address the root cause of the 'ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED' error:** This issue is causing significant browser slowdown and user frustration. Identify why the extension is repeatedly trying to connect to 'http://127.0.0.1:1000/.well-known/health' and resolve the underlying problem.",
    "**Improve error handling and messaging within the extension:** Provide more user-friendly error messages that clearly explain the problem and potential solutions. Consider adding retry logic or a fallback mechanism to handle connection failures gracefully.",
    "**Develop a process for categorizing support tickets:** This will help to identify trends and prioritize issues more effectively.  Create clear categories and train support staff on how to use them.",
    "**Consider creating a dedicated knowledge base article or FAQ entry:** Address the 'ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED' error. This will empower users to troubleshoot the issue themselves and potentially reduce the number of incoming support tickets.",
    "**Monitor the effectiveness of these recommendations:** Track the number of tickets related to this issue over time to assess the impact of the implemented changes. "
