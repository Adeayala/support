Additionally, there seem to be significant scroll issues, and the code view doesn't appear to be calculating line numbers correctly, showing many empty lines after line 1,918, when line 2,837 is the last line in the file.\n\nFinally, the Pieces Desktop code view shows a wrap in the line number margin.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9be69032-f2e2-4379-843c-cd0bf14da63a)\nNo comments found on this issue.",
