I opened the Pieces plugin and using default settings prompted it to describe the script: \"What does this Python script do?\" The UE plugin never returns any content and seems to be unresponsive. \n\nIn Pieces Desktop, I do see the result, however interaction with it is latent indicating some sort of continual background processing even though the LLM has completed processing. Additionally, there seem to be significant scroll issues, and the code view doesn't appear to be calculating line numbers correctly, showing many empty lines after line 1,918, when line 2,837 is the last line in the file.\n\nFinally, the Pieces Desktop code view shows a wrap in the line number margin.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9be69032-f2e2-4379-843c-cd0bf14da63a)\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Title:** (Missing)\n\n**Author:** pieces-support-bot\n\n**Date:** 2025-01-13\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The user's issue was automatically triaged by the bot.\n* The bot recommends checking related issues and resources.\n* The user should receive a follow-up from the Pieces support team within 24 hours.\n\n**Problems:** (None explicitly stated)\n\n* The user's specific issue is not identified.\n* It's unclear if the user requires immediate assistance.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The bot provides links to relevant resources and related issues.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is acknowledged and assigned to the Pieces support team.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* This summary is based on the limited information provided in the conversation excerpt. \n* More context is required to fully understand and address the user's problem.",
