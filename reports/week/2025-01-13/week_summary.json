We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot! You can schedule a call [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2iaRWpd1kA2k_xg2KrVi_jiTHo0POiMZSI9WAYsxs5jJ9sU2Rd2zKitLuSFd7l3FhatGzy5Vgt\r\n). \r\n\r\nA short-term solution is to restart PiecesOS whenever this occurs. \n## GitHub Issue Summary: Pieces OS High RAM Usage and CPU Spikes\n\nThis conversation on the Pieces GitHub repository covers the issue of Pieces OS demanding high amounts of RAM and spiking CPU usage, hindering user experience.\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Users on various platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) experience high RAM usage, ranging from 2GB to 5GB, even with limited or no active usage.\n* RAM spike issues persist after clicking \"Optimize Memory\" with usage increasing again immediately.\n* CPU usage spikes to ~50% and even as high as 120%, causing substantial performance drops\n* These issues make running Pieces impractical at times, forcing some users to uninstall.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* High RAM utilization, exceeding usual expectations (~2GB) for idle or normal scenarios.\n* High CPU spikes, significantly slowing down device performance.\n* Ongoing memory leak suspected for exceeding resource usage.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* \"Optimize Memory\" feature to partially address RAM concerns.\n* Development focused on improving PiecesOS overall performance and reducing resource intensive tasks.\n* Offering personal troubleshooting sessions to investigate individual cases with user collaboration.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* High RAM & CPU usage remains significant for specific users, causing some to abandon Pieces despite its positive features.\n* Ongoing optimization endeavors target resolving these difficulties.\n\n**Possible Solutions Not Yet Mentioned in Comments:**\n\n* Implementing \"off-device\" processing/computation options: This might be implemented for tasks not requiring live interaction\n* Providing configuration tweaks for users to personalize resource allocation and trade-off performance for lower resource burden.\n* Improved on-device AI model caching and memory management systems. \n\nFurther community feedback remains essential to prioritize fixing these issues. Addressing the concerns outlined in this summary is crucial for future development and wider user base expansion for Pieces.",
