We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot!

I opened the Pieces plugin and using default settings prompted it to describe the script: \"What does this Python script do?\" The UE plugin never returns any content and seems to be unresponsive. \n\nIn Pieces Desktop, I do see the result, however interaction with it is latent indicating some sort of continual background processing even though the LLM has completed processing. Additionally, there seem to be significant scroll issues, and the code view doesn't appear to be calculating line numbers correctly, showing many empty lines after line 1,918, when line 2,837 is the last line in the file.\n\nFinally, the Pieces Desktop code view shows a wrap in the line number margin.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9be69032-f2e2-4379-843c-cd0bf14da63a)\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User @bschwenk reported two issues:\n    * Context problems with a specific .py file when using Gemini 1.5 flash and gpt4o.\n    * Line numbers wrapping in the response.\n* @mark-at-pieces confirmed the context issue and assigned it to @sam-at-pieces for further investigation.\n* @mark-at-pieces also requested @mack-at-pieces to look into the line number wrapping issue.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* **Context Issue:** The system did not correctly include the user's .py file in the context, leading to irrelevant responses.\n* **Line Number Wrapping:** Line numbers in the response were wrapping, making them difficult to read.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* **Context Issue:** @sam-at-pieces proposed a fix for the context issue.\n* **Line Number Wrapping:** @mark-at-pieces assigned the line number wrapping issue to @mack-at-pieces for further investigation.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* **Context Issue:** The fix for the context issue is included in the upcoming release of 11.0.4.\n* **Line Number Wrapping:** The status of the line number wrapping issue is not mentioned in the conversation.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation took place on January 13th, 14th, and 15th, 2025.\n* The user expressed appreciation for the support team's responsiveness and assistance.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolution of connectivity issues:** Focus on addressing the root causes of connection errors across different Pieces platforms (web, desktop, VS Code) and within Docker containers. This will likely involve investigating API key handling, remote connection protocols, and potential service stability improvements.",
    "**Investigate and address PiecesOS performance issues:** Look into reports of high RAM/CPU usage, potentially caused by internet connectivity problems or inefficient background processes. Optimize PiecesOS for better resource management and investigate potential memory leaks.",
    "**Improve Pieces Copilot and Neural Code Search reliability:** Address issues with Copilot unresponsiveness, errors, and irrelevant responses, particularly with specific file types or language models. Enhance Neural Code Search to ensure consistent and accurate results. This might involve reviewing language model integrations, API interactions, and software logic.",
    "**Proactively communicate known issues and workarounds:** Keep users informed about ongoing problems, such as those related to specific language models (Claude, Gemini) or OpenAI API keys. Provide clear workarounds, such as switching to alternative language models or removing API keys, to minimize user disruption.",
    "**Enhance support documentation and resources:** Expand documentation to include detailed troubleshooting steps for common issues like connectivity problems, API key management, and language model selection. Create or update help articles and tutorials addressing these specific areas.",
    "**Gather more detailed user feedback:** Encourage users to provide comprehensive bug reports, including steps to reproduce the issue, relevant screenshots, and system information. This will help in identifying patterns and root causes more effectively.",
    "**Consider implementing a status page:** Create a public status page to communicate service uptime and any ongoing outages or maintenance activities. This will keep users informed and manage expectations during service disruptions.",
    "**Review and optimize large file handling:** Investigate how Pieces handles large files, as this appears to be a potential contributor to performance issues. Explore optimizations or limitations to improve user experience with larger codebases or datasets.",
    "**Analyze and address trends in user-reported issues:** Regularly analyze support tickets to identify recurring problems and prioritize development efforts accordingly. This data-driven approach will help allocate resources effectively and address the most impactful issues first."
