I opened the Pieces plugin and using default settings prompted it to describe the script: \"What does this Python script do?\" The UE plugin never returns any content and seems to be unresponsive. \n\nIn Pieces Desktop, I do see the result, however interaction with it is latent indicating some sort of continual background processing even though the LLM has completed processing.
