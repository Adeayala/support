- **Investigate and address the root cause of Neural Code Search failures:**  No results returned from search severely hinders user workflows and necessitates a prompt fix.
- **Improve search functionality documentation and user guidance:** Provide clearer explanations of different search methods (NCS, FTS, Blended) and their limitations to manage user expectations.
- **Gather more detailed logs and system information:**  Request detailed logs and system information from users experiencing launch issues to aid in troubleshooting and identifying potential solutions.
- **Consider creating a dedicated troubleshooting guide for Windows users:**  A comprehensive guide addressing common Windows-specific issues can alleviate support volume and empower users to self-resolve problems.
