I opened the Pieces plugin and using default settings prompted it to describe the script: \"What does this Python script do?\" The UE plugin never returns any content and seems to be unresponsive. \n\nIn Pieces Desktop, I do see the result, however interaction with it is latent indicating some sort of continual background processing even though the LLM has completed processing. Additionally, there seem to be significant scroll issues, and the code view doesn't appear to be calculating line numbers correctly, showing many empty lines after line 1,918, when line 2,837 is the last line in the file.\n\nFinally, the Pieces Desktop code view shows a wrap in the line number margin.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9be69032-f2e2-4379-843c-cd0bf14da63a)\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User bschwenk reported two issues with Pieces:\n    * Context issues while using a specific .py file with Gemini 1.5 and GPT-4o.\n    * Line number wrapping issues.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* The .py file was not included in the context, leading to the \"Please provide the file itself\" response.\n* Line numbers were wrapping incorrectly.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* The context issue was fixed by @mark-at-pieces and @sam-at-pieces.\n* The line number wrapping issue was identified and will be addressed in a future release.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The context issue has been resolved and will be released in Pieces version 11.0.4.\n* The line number wrapping issue is still under investigation.\n\n**Additional information:**\n\n* The issue was automatically triaged and routed to the Pieces support team.\n* The user was provided with links to relevant resources.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize bug fixes for the Pieces Desktop Application:** The majority of support tickets are related to bugs in the desktop app, particularly plugin unresponsiveness, code view issues, and persistent welcome messages. Focusing on resolving these issues should be a top priority.",
    "**Improve Neural Code Search functionality:** Investigate and address the issue of Neural Code Search returning no results for some users. This feature is important for code discovery and its malfunction significantly impacts user experience.",
    "**Review welcome message behavior:** Address the bug causing the saved snippets welcome message to appear repeatedly. While seemingly minor, this can be disruptive to the user workflow.",
    "**Gather more detailed bug reports:** Encourage users to provide comprehensive information when reporting bugs, including software versions, operating systems, and steps to reproduce the issue. This will help developers identify and fix issues more efficiently.",
    "**Consider creating a dedicated FAQ or troubleshooting guide for common issues:** This could help users resolve problems independently and reduce the number of support tickets submitted for known issues. "
