      "description": "The Pieces plugin for UltraEdit becomes unresponsive when asked to analyze large Python scripts (around 3000 lines). This issue seems to stem from continuous background processing even after the LLM completes its analysis. Users have reported latency, scrolling problems, and inaccurate line numbers in the Pieces Desktop app. A potential fix involving context inclusion is under investigation and will be rolled out in a future release.",

I opened the Pieces plugin and using default settings prompted it to describe the script: \"What does this Python script do?\" The UE plugin never returns any content and seems to be unresponsive. \n\nIn Pieces Desktop, I do see the result, however interaction with it is latent indicating some sort of continual background processing even though the LLM has completed processing. Additionally, there seem to be significant scroll issues, and the code view doesn't appear to be calculating line numbers correctly, showing many empty lines after line 1,918, when line 2,837 is the last line in the file.\n\nFinally, the Pieces Desktop code view shows a wrap in the line number margin.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9be69032-f2e2-4379-843c-cd0bf14da63a)\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* @bschwenk reported two issues:\n    * Context issues with Gemini 1.5 flash and gpt4o.\n    * Line numbers wrapping.\n* @mark-at-pieces confirmed the context issue and is investigating the cause.\n* @mark-at-pieces asked @sam-at-pieces to help test the issue.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The file is not getting included in the context when using Gemini 1.5 flash and gpt4o.\n* Line numbers are wrapping.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* @mark-at-pieces and @sam-at-pieces believe they have a fix for the context issue.\n* The proposed fix will be included in the next release.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The proposed fix is not yet implemented.\n* The issue is expected to be resolved in the next release.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* Related issues:\n    * Copilot is not giving any feedback\n    * Copilot Bug: 'I'm sorry. Something went wrong with processing.

    "**Investigate and resolve the unresponsiveness issue with the Pieces plugin for UltraEdit when handling large Python scripts.** This appears to be a significant bottleneck impacting user experience.",
    "**Address the latency, scrolling problems, and inaccurate line numbers in the Pieces Desktop app.** These issues are likely related to the background processing problem and should be resolved to improve usability.",
    "**Provide clear communication to users about the ongoing work on the context inclusion fix for the Pieces plugin.** Transparency will manage expectations and reduce frustration.",
    "**Monitor the effectiveness of the proposed fix for the context issue in the next release.** Gather user feedback to ensure the issue is fully resolved.",
    "**Consider implementing performance optimizations for the Pieces plugin to handle large files more efficiently.** This could involve optimizing background processes, improving code parsing, or providing options to limit the scope of analysis.",
    "**Review and update documentation and support resources to address the reported issues.** Provide clear instructions and troubleshooting steps for users experiencing similar problems.",
    "**Explore potential enhancements to the Pieces plugin, such as progress indicators or the ability to pause/cancel analysis, to improve user experience during long processing times.**"
