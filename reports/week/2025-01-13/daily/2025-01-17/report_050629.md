## Common Issues
### 1. Conversation titles auto-save prematurely during editing
Users are experiencing an issue where conversation titles in the Pieces Desktop app are automatically saved before the editing process is complete. This occurs when clicking on the title to edit it, and the input is saved prematurely, even if the user is still actively modifying the title.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize bug fixes:** Given the high frequency of bug reports, particularly related to conversation titles auto-saving prematurely, prioritize addressing this issue to improve user experience.
- **Improve documentation for 'on the roadmap' requests:**  A significant number of tickets fall under 'on the roadmap'. Enhance documentation to clarify which features are planned, their timelines, and how users can track their progress. This can reduce inquiries about existing feature requests.
- **Investigate macOS-specific issues:**  All reported issues originate from macOS. Focus on testing and debugging the macOS application to identify and resolve any platform-specific problems.
- **Consider implementing input delay for conversation titles:** To address the auto-saving issue, explore implementing a slight delay before saving conversation titles. This would allow users sufficient time to complete their edits without interruption.
