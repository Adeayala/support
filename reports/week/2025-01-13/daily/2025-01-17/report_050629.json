  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize bug fixes:** Given the high frequency of bug reports, particularly related to conversation titles auto-saving prematurely, prioritize addressing this issue to improve user experience.",
    "**Improve documentation for 'on the roadmap' requests:**  A significant number of tickets fall under 'on the roadmap'. Enhance documentation to clarify which features are planned, their timelines, and how users can track their progress. This can reduce inquiries about existing feature requests.",
    "**Investigate macOS-specific issues:**  All reported issues originate from macOS. Focus on testing and debugging the macOS application to identify and resolve any platform-specific problems.",
    "**Consider implementing input delay for conversation titles:** To address the auto-saving issue, explore implementing a slight delay before saving conversation titles. This would allow users sufficient time to complete their edits without interruption."
