## Common Issues
### 1. Extension causes "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" errors
The web extension repeatedly attempts to access "http://127.0.0.1:1000/.well-known/health", leading to "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" errors when there's no service listening at that address. This causes Chrome performance issues. Disabling and re-enabling the extension temporarily resolves the problem. The root cause appears to be within the extension's code.
