I opened the Pieces plugin and using default settings prompted it to describe the script: \"What does this Python script do?\" The UE plugin never returns any content and seems to be unresponsive. \n\nIn Pieces Desktop, I do see the result, however interaction with it is latent indicating some sort of continual background processing even though the LLM has completed processing. Additionally, there seem to be significant scroll issues, and the code view doesn't appear to be calculating line numbers correctly, showing many empty lines after line 1,918, when line 2,837 is the last line in the file.\n\nFinally, the Pieces Desktop code view shows a wrap in the line number margin.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9be69032-f2e2-4379-843c-cd0bf14da63a)\nNo comments found on this issue.",
