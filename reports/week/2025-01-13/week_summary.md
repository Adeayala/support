## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Copilot Connectivity Issues in Remote Environments
Users are experiencing difficulties connecting to Pieces Copilot from VS Code in remote environments like WSL2 and Docker containers.  The issues often involve network connectivity problems, specifically with Pieces OS listening on the loopback interface. Solutions include ensuring Pieces OS listens on all interfaces, configuring custom URLs in VS Code settings, and using the 'host.docker.internal' resolution for Docker environments.
