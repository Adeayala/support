## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces plugin and extension unresponsiveness
Users reported unresponsiveness and errors with the Pieces plugin for UltraEdit and the Chrome extension, especially when handling large files. Issues include plugin freezing, browser slowdown, and console errors. This is likely due to resource-intensive background processing.  Disabling and re-enabling the extension temporarily resolves the issue. A fix is expected in an upcoming release.
