| [#540](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/540) | LTM doesn't work; the copilot model by defaults not saved | 7.30 |

## Common Issues
### 1. LTM Engine Not Enabling After Update
Users report that the Long-Term Memory (LTM) engine is not enabling after updating to PiecesOS 11.0.0 and Desktop application 3.3.0. This is due to the downloaded local LLM overriding saved data. A patch (PiecesOS 11.0.1 and Desktop application 3.3.1) was released but some users still report issues.

## Recommendations
- **Investigate LTM Engine Issues:** Prioritize resolving the persistent issues with the Long-Term Memory (LTM) engine not enabling after the update. Focus on why the patch (PiecesOS 11.0.1 and Desktop application 3.3.1) hasn't resolved the problem for all users.
- **Improve Patch Testing:** Enhance the testing procedures for patches to ensure they effectively address reported issues before release.
- **Gather More User Data:** Collect more detailed feedback from users experiencing the LTM issue, including their operating systems, Pieces OS versions, and specific error messages. This will help pinpoint the root cause.
- **Update Documentation and Communication:**  Provide clear and updated documentation on the LTM engine, including troubleshooting steps for common issues. Communicate known issues and workarounds to users through release notes or support channels.
