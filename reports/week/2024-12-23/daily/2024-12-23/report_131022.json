  "recommendations": [
    "**Investigate LTM Engine Issues:** Prioritize resolving the persistent issues with the Long-Term Memory (LTM) engine not enabling after the update. Focus on why the patch (PiecesOS 11.0.1 and Desktop application 3.3.1) hasn't resolved the problem for all users.",
    "**Improve Patch Testing:** Enhance the testing procedures for patches to ensure they effectively address reported issues before release.",
    "**Gather More User Data:** Collect more detailed feedback from users experiencing the LTM issue, including their operating systems, Pieces OS versions, and specific error messages. This will help pinpoint the root cause.",
    "**Update Documentation and Communication:**  Provide clear and updated documentation on the LTM engine, including troubleshooting steps for common issues. Communicate known issues and workarounds to users through release notes or support channels."
