If so, why does it fail to communicate further?\r\n\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The `Pieces` extension for VS Code was not able to connect to the Pieces OS instance.\n* The issue was caused by the extension needing to access Pieces OS via the `host.docker.internal` DNS name, which was not available when Pieces OS wasn't running.\n* A temporary solution was found by setting the `custom url` option in the extension settings.\n* A more permanent solution is being developed to automatically detect and connect to Pieces OS regardless of its state.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The extension was unable to connect to Pieces OS by default.\n* The required DNS name was only available when Pieces OS was running.\n* Users needed to manually configure the extension to connect.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Setting the `custom url` option to `http://host.docker.internal:1000`.\n* Automatically detecting and connecting to Pieces OS regardless of its state.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The temporary solution using the `custom url` option is working.\n* The permanent solution is being developed and will be released in a future update.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user also suggested allowing users to specify multiple URLs in the `pieces.customUrl` setting.\n* The discussion also highlighted the need for better support for remote development environments.\n* A new notification on startup will inform users when a remote environment is detected and provide a link to the documentation.",
