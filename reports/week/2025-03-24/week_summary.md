- **Improve Communication on Beta Features:** Clearly communicate to users which features are in beta and manage expectations regarding potential issues. Provide timelines for full release and bug fixes.
- **Consider a Bug Bounty Program:** Incentivize users to report bugs and security vulnerabilities by implementing a bug bounty program. This can help identify and resolve issues more quickly.
