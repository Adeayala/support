- Develop a solution to allow users to cancel LLLM downloads, as the inability to do so is causing frustration.
- Prioritize resolving the long-standing issue of users being unable to generate personal shareable links, which has persisted for over 6 months.
- Improve communication with users who report issues, ensuring their concerns are addressed and not disregarded, especially for recurring problems like the shareable links bug.
- Consider creating more specific categories for bug reports, such as 'Performance Issues' or 'Shareable Links', to better categorize and track similar issues in the future.
