## Recommendations
- "Investigate and address the performance issues with Long Term Memory reported by users, particularly the high CPU usage. This is a recurring issue with high activity and impacts user experience."
- "Look into the bug preventing users from canceling LLLM downloads. While the activity level is lower, it still hinders the user experience."
- "Prioritize resolving the issue with generating personal shareable links. This bug has persisted for over 6 months and significantly impacts users' ability to share content."
- "Improve communication and avoid disregarding user issues. The user who reported the shareable link problem had their previous report closed without resolution, leading to frustration."
- "Consider creating dedicated troubleshooting guides or FAQs for common issues like slow performance and shareable link problems. This can help users resolve issues independently and reduce support tickets."
