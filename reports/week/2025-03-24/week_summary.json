After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\nError generating summary: 400 Project `640481513740` is not allowed to use Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro`",
