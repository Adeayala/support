After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\nError generating summary: 400 Project `640481513740` is not allowed to use Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro`",

  "recommendations": [
    "\"Investigate and address the performance issues with Long Term Memory reported by users, particularly the high CPU usage. This is a recurring issue with high activity and impacts user experience.\"",
    "\"Look into the bug preventing users from canceling LLLM downloads. While the activity level is lower, it still hinders the user experience.\"",
    "\"Prioritize resolving the issue with generating personal shareable links. This bug has persisted for over 6 months and significantly impacts users' ability to share content.\"",
    "\"Improve communication and avoid disregarding user issues. The user who reported the shareable link problem had their previous report closed without resolution, leading to frustration.\"",
    "\"Consider creating dedicated troubleshooting guides or FAQs for common issues like slow performance and shareable link problems. This can help users resolve issues independently and reduce support tickets.\""
