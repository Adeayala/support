After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\nError generating summary: 400 Project `640481513740` is not allowed to use Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro`",

  "recommendations": [
    "Investigate and address the performance issues with Long Term Memory reported by Pieces OS users, particularly the slow down experienced even after updating to LTM-2.",
    "Develop a solution to allow users to cancel LLLM downloads, as the inability to do so is causing frustration.",
    "Prioritize resolving the long-standing issue of users being unable to generate personal shareable links, which has persisted for over 6 months.",
    "Improve communication with users who report issues, ensuring their concerns are addressed and not disregarded, especially for recurring problems like the shareable links bug.",
    "Consider creating more specific categories for bug reports, such as 'Performance Issues' or 'Shareable Links', to better categorize and track similar issues in the future."
