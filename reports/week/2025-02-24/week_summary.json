Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary: Account Linking Issues\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User johnkennyuk was experiencing issues linking their Pieces account with GitHub and Google accounts.\n* The original account linking system was outdated and not performing as expected.\n* A new system was under development and scheduled to replace the old one in late February.\n* johnkennyuk experienced a single character capitalization inconsistency between their Google and GitHub emails, which may have been a contributing factor.\n\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking flow was problematic and not straightforward.\n* An email capitalization inconsistency might have hindered the linking process.\n\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Pieces support offered to manually link the two accounts.\n* A new account linking system was under development and planned for release in February (later pushed to early/mid March).\n* Support suggested johnkennyuk wait for the new system instead of further troubleshooting the old one.\n\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The problem was not fully resolved.\n* johnkennyuk agreed to wait for the new account linking system.\n* Pieces support will re-engage the issue once the new system is released.\n\n**Additional Points:**\n\n* Pieces acknowledged the issue with the old system and is actively working on a replacement.\n* The new system aims to resolve all linking issues and streamline the user experience.\n* There was a slight delay in the development of the new system.\n* Johnkennyuk is expected to be among the first users to test the new linking system.",

My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation on Ollama server issues in Pieces OS\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n*  John is experiencing issues with the Ollama server on his Pieces OS installation, specifically Cuda errors.\n* He has tried reinstalling both the server and Pieces OS several times, but the problem persists.\n* He suspects that the issue might be related to the startup order of Ollama and Pieces OS, as the server only seems to work if he restarts it separately after logging into Pieces OS.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n* Incorrect Cuda dlls are being used.\n* Conflicting Ollama installations. \n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n* Reinstall Ollama using the OllamaSetup.exe installer. \n* Clean previous installation before re-installation.\n* Update to Pieces OS version 11.1.2.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n* The problem was temporarily fixed by reinstalling, but it reappeared after updates and re-installs.\n* The latest update to Pieces OS 11.1.2 may have fixed the race condition causing the problem. \n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* John uses winget for installations and uninstalls. \n* He has uninstalled both Ollama and Pieces OS, then re-installed Ollama first, and then re-installed Pieces OS, but Pieces OS still ignores the existing Ollama instance.\n* The issue might only occur if John logs into Pieces OS quickly enough that Ollama starts before Pieces OS attempts to launch it.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* The issue requires further investigation to identify the root cause and implement a permanent fix. \n* A call between John and Brian might be necessary to further debug and diagnose the problem.",
