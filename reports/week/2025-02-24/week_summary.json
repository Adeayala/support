Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of Github Issue Conversation with johnkennyuk\n\n**Problem:** johnkennyuk is unable to link his Github account to his Pieces account using the shared email address. This is likely due to a minor inconsistency in capitalization between emails registered with Pieces' auth provider.\n\n**Solution:**\n* **Short Term:**\n    * Mark (Pieces support) reset johnkennyuk's Github account to attempt a re-link.\n    * Requested johnkennyuk to disable email privacy in Github settings.\n    * Suggested waiting for the new auth system due to limitations of the current one.\n* **Long Term:**\n    * Pieces is actively working on a new auth system scheduled for mid to late March 2025. This system will allow for easier and more reliable account linking, including accounts with slight email variations like capitalization differences.\n\n**Outcome:**\n* The current account linking attempt with Github was unsuccessful.\n* johnkennyuk opted to wait for the new auth system before attempting to re-link.\n* Mark will follow up when the new system is ready, and johnkennyuk will be prioritized for early access and testing.\n\n**Key points:**\n* Account linking flow is currently not ideal and being replaced.\n* Github account linked to johnkennyuk's Google account using the same email.\n* Minor inconsistency in email capitalization may be causing the issue.\n* New auth system expected to fix the account linking issues.\n\n**Current Status:**\n* Issue remains open and pending the new auth system launch.\n* Mark will provide an update and assist johnkennyuk with the re-linking process once the new system is available.",
