Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Problem:** User johnkennyuk reported an issue with account linking not working correctly. Their Github account and Google account were not merging properly.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Account linking flow was not working as intended.\n* User preferred to keep their Google account as the primary account.\n* There was a capitalization issue in the user's email addresses that might be causing the problem.\n* The current authentication service was being replaced with a new one in March.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark, a Pieces support member, offered to manually merge the accounts.\n* Mark suggested disabling email privacy setting in Github.\n* Mark reset the user's Github account multiple times.\n* Mark suggested waiting for the new authentication service to be implemented.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The new authentication service is still under development and is expected to be released in early/mid March.\n* The user is waiting for the new system to be implemented before attempting another account link.\n* The issue will be revisited when the new authentication service is released.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user confirmed that email addresses are not case-sensitive and suggested that the capitalization issue might be the root cause of the problem. \n* The new authentication service will allow for linking accounts even if the emails are different.",

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance.

This was resolved by removing the key.\n* The local LLM issue was likely due to hardware constraints. This was fixed by using a smaller local LLM.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Issues with both cloud and local LLMs have been resolved.",
