Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## GitHub Issue Summary: Account Linking Issue\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User johnkennyuk is experiencing issues with account linking on Pieces app.\n* His Github and Google accounts are not properly merged, causing problems.\n* The existing account linking system is outdated and causing issues.\n* A new system is being developed and will be released in early/mid March.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow is not user-friendly and causing merge issues.\n* Potential issue with capitalization difference in user's email addresses.\n* Delay in the release of the new account linking system.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Temporary fix offered by Pieces support to merge accounts manually.\n* User advised to wait for the new account linking system.\n* New system should resolve merge issues and inconsistencies.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User opted to wait for the new system instead of further troubleshooting.\n* New system is in development and expected to be released in early/mid March.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* User acknowledged the delay and expressed willingness to wait for the new system.\n* Pieces support will follow up when the new system is available.",
