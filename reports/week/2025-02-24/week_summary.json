Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (johnkennyuk) is experiencing issues linking their personal and GitHub accounts in Pieces.\n* The existing account linking flow is not working correctly and is being actively replaced.\n* User has two accounts, one using their personal domain email on Google and one using their Github account.\n* The goal is to merge the accounts, with the Google account as the main one.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not intuitive and causes confusion.\n* There may be an issue with case sensitivity in email addresses causing the merge to fail.\n* The current authentication service has limitations.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark (support staff) offered to manually merge the accounts.\n* User was instructed to sign out and sign back in to trigger the account linking flow.\n* Mark suggested disabling email privacy settings in GitHub to troubleshoot.\n* A new authentication service is being developed that will address these issues.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The initial attempt to merge the accounts failed, possibly due to the case sensitivity issue.\n* User is waiting for the new authentication service to be implemented.\n* Mark will reengage the issue when the new service is closer to release.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new authentication service is expected to be available in early/mid March 2025.\n* It is unclear whether existing account data will be migrated to the new service.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n* Mark to reset the user's GitHub account and leave only the Google account.\n* Mark to follow up with the user when the new authentication service is ready.",

If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4.
