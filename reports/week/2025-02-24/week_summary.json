Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (@johnkennyuk) is experiencing login problems with their multiple Pieces accounts.\n* The accounts were originally registered separately due to a bug in the application.\n* User wants to merge existing accounts and have their Google account as the master account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow is cumbersome and not intuitive.\n* Potential issue with a capitalization difference in the email address for both accounts on different platforms (GitHub vs. Google).\n* Existing auth service provider (being replaced) causes issues with account inconsistencies.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Merging user accounts once the user logs in with their Google or GitHub account.\n* Providing additional support via calendar scheduling for a personalized approach.\n* Temporarily disabling email privacy settings on GitHub.\n* Resetting user's  GitHub account link.\n* Implementing a new account linking flow with the new auth service provider in March 2025.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User was able to sign in with their Github account but couldn't link it to their main Google account due to a possible capitalization issue in the email addresses.\n* User decided to wait for the implementation of the new account linking flow in March 2025.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Issue is open and unresolved.\n* User will be notified when the new system is ready for testing.\n* New system rollout is expected in March 2025 as part of a larger release and product launch.",

Sometimes, (possibly after a background update?), this dialog appears on my desktop. I don't know what it means, exactly, but I cannot click \"Ok\" and there is no other way to dismiss it. My only option appears to be to restart the computer, which is often impractical.

This happens when trying to launch Pieces or after 10 minutes of use. The overlay is non-dismissable and restarting VS Code or Pieces Desktop doesn't fix it. Only a computer restart resolves the issue, making it highly disruptive.\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* ThemePark initially reported an issue with Pieces Desktop not launching on Windows 10. \n* Mack, the Pieces support representative, identified a potential conflict between Pieces Desktop launch on startup and PiecesOS updates.\n* ThemePark confirmed they were launching PiecesOS on startup. \n* Additional information revealed the issue occurs with Pieces for VS Code and is not specific to Pieces Desktop.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Mack suggested changing the startup application to either Pieces Desktop or removing both from startup to avoid the timing conflict.\n* ThemePark explored different startup configurations but the issue persisted.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The root cause of the problem is still being investigated. \n* ThemePark provided further details on the issue, including screenshots and the observation that the problem also occurs with VS Code.\n* The issue remains unresolved and is causing significant disruption to ThemePark's workflow.",
