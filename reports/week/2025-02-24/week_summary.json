Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (@johnkennyuk) experiencing issues with account linking between Github and Google accounts in the Pieces app.\n* Current account linking flow is outdated and not working properly.\n* New account linking system is currently under development.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing accounts were registered separately due to bugs in earlier versions of the application.\n* Inconsistency in capitalization of email addresses between Github and Google accounts.\n* New account linking system not yet available.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Account merging was attempted to resolve the issue.\n* Github account was reset for a fresh linking attempt.\n* Email privacy settings on Github were temporarily disabled.\n* New account linking system is being developed for a late February/early March release.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Issue not yet resolved due to inconsistencies in email capitalization and the need for the new account linking system.\n* User will wait for the new system to be implemented before attempting another account link.\n* New system expected to be available in mid-March 2025.\n\n**Other Notes:**\n\n* User expressed interest in being an early tester for the new account linking system.\n* Developer confirmed they will reach out to the user when the new system is ready.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe account linking issue has not been fully resolved yet due to a few remaining issues. However, a new and improved account linking system is currently under development and is expected to be available soon. This new system should address the existing problems and allow for smooth account linking between Github and Google accounts.",
