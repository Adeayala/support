Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (@johnkennyuk) is experiencing issues linking their Github and Google accounts.\n* The current account linking process is not working properly.\n* User prefers to keep their Google account as the main account.\n* User wants to wait for the new sign-in system to be implemented before attempting to link again.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not functioning correctly.\n* User's Google and Github email addresses have a capitalization discrepancy.\n* The old auth service provider has limitations causing inconsistencies.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark (@mark-at-pieces) reset the user's Github account multiple times.\n* User was advised to temporarily disable email privacy settings on Github.\n* User was advised to adjust the capitalization of their email address on Github.\n* Mark confirmed that a new sign-in system is being developed and will be released in early/mid March.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is unresolved as of February 23rd, 2025.\n* The new sign-in system is still under development and expected to be released in early/mid March.\n* User will wait for the new system before attempting to link their accounts again.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue is likely caused by a capitalization discrepancy in the user's email addresses.\n* The old auth service provider is being replaced, which should resolve the account linking issues.",
