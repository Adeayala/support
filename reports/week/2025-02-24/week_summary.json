It is unclear if these are the same method or two different methods.\n* The specific version of Pieces OS and Ollama used are not mentioned in the conversation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* To get a complete picture of the issue and its resolution, reviewing the entire conversation and any follow-up comments or updates would be helpful.\n* If the issue remains unresolved, providing more details about the specific error message and the versions of Pieces OS and Ollama used would facilitate further troubleshooting.",

My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Title:** Ollama Server crashing on startup in PiecesOS\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* Ollama server crashes on startup when installed through PiecesOS but works fine when installed separately.\n* User suspects Cuda related issue with the included Ollama version in PiecesOS.\n* Conflicting startup order with PiecesOS and the external Ollama instance.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Clean uninstall and reinstall of Ollama and PiecesOS.\n* Path cleanup to ensure the correct Ollama executable is used.\n* Detection of external Ollama instance implemented in PiecesOS version 11.1.2.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue is resolved for the user after multiple reinstalls and path cleanup, but the cause remains unclear.\n* Potential fix implemented in PiecesOS 11.1.2 to address race condition causing the crash.\n* User requested further clarification on external Ollama instance detection and prevention of automatic Ollama installation.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The issue seems to be related to the user's specific setup and timing of startup processes.\n* Further investigation and testing are needed to confirm the root cause and ensure a permanent solution.",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1.
