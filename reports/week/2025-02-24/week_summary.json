The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.

My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Ollama Installation Issues on PiecesOS - Conversation Summary\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User (johnkennyuk) experienced installation issues with Ollama on PiecesOS.\n* Ollama failed to work correctly with PiecesOS, throwing Cuda errors.\n* User tried reinstalling Ollama and PiecesOS but the problem persisted.\n* Startup order of Ollama and PiecesOS was suspected to be causing the issue.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Multiple installations of Ollama caused conflicts.\n* Ollama installed via PiecesOS may not have been complete or correct.\n* Startup order of Ollama and PiecesOS could be problematic.\n* Race condition preventing external Ollama instance detection.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Uninstalling both Ollama and PiecesOS and then reinstalling Ollama first.\n* Checking and cleaning PATH environment variables.\n* Investigating `ollama` keyword in the PATH.\n* Restarting Ollama and PiecesOS.\n* Upgrading to version 11.1.2 of PiecesOS, which includes a fix for the race condition.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The user initially resolved the issue through repeated uninstalls and path cleanups, though the cause remains unknown.\n* The problem reoccurred after updates.\n* The user is looking for a more definitive solution.\n* PiecesOS developers are aware of the race condition and have implemented a fix in a recent release.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* User primarily uses winget for installation and updates.\n* User's initial query focused on detecting external Ollama instances and preventing PiecesOS from installing its own.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis conversation highlights the complexity of software interactions and potential conflicts between different installations.

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance.
