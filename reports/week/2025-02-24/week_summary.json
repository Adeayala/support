My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Conversation Regarding Ollama Server Issues\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* @johnkennyuk was experiencing issues with Ollama server on Pieces OS due to conflicting Cuda12 DLLs.\n* The issue was initially thought to be caused by a corrupt Ollama installation, but reinstalling both Ollama and Pieces OS didn't resolve it.\n* @johnkennyuk observed that the issue was related to startup order, with Pieces OS attempting to start its own Ollama instance before the external one was fully initialized.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Conflicting Cuda12 DLLs between Pieces OS and external Ollama installations.\n* Race condition caused by Pieces OS attempting to start its own Ollama instance before the external one was ready.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Reinstalling Ollama and Pieces OS.\n* Cleaning up PATH environment variables.\n* Disabling Pieces OS launch on sign-in as a workaround.\n* Detecting the presence of an external Ollama instance.\n* Using CLI to check if an external Ollama instance is running.\n* Pushing a change in Pieces OS version 11.1.2 to address the race condition.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue seems to have been resolved for @johnkennyuk after several uninstalls and path cleanups.\n* A potential fix was implemented in Pieces OS version 11.1.2, but further testing is required to confirm its effectiveness.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* @johnkennyuk is still experiencing the issue occasionally.\n* @brian-at-pieces is open to scheduling a call to help troubleshoot the issue further.\n\n## Key Takeaways:\n\n* The issue seems to be related to conflicting DLLs and a race condition.\n* A potential fix has been implemented, but further testing is needed.\n* @johnkennyuk is still experiencing the issue and is seeking further assistance.",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Conversation Summary: Account Linking Issues on Pieces\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk, a Pieces user, raised an issue regarding the inability to link his personal domain (registered to his Google account) to his Github account on the platform.\n* Both accounts were initially registered separately due to bugs in older versions of the app, leading to the current linking complications.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The existing account linking flow was cumbersome and not user-friendly.\n* Johnkennyuk was unable to successfully merge his accounts using Github authentication, despite attempts to resolve the issue directly with Pieces support.\n* There were minor inconsistencies between Johnkennyuk's Google and Github emails (a capitalized first letter in Google).\n* Github doesn't display email address during account linking consent, potentially contributing to confusion.\n* The current authentication service was known to have limitations and was soon to be replaced.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Pieces support offered to manually merge Johnkennyuk's accounts.\n* A screen recording was requested to diagnose the problem further.\n* Pieces support temporarily disabled email privacy on Johnkennyuk's Github account.\n* Johnkennyuk's Github account was reset multiple times.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Unfortunately, Johnkennyuk couldn't successfully link his accounts, possibly due to the email inconsistency.\n* Pieces support are developing a new account linking system due for mid-March 2025 to resolve such issues.\n* Johnkennyuk will wait for the new system implementation and be among the first users to test it out. \n* Johnkennyuk's Github account will be reset again before testing the new system.\n\n**Overall, a solution for account linking is pending the release of a new authentication system in March 2025. Johnkennyuk will then have his accounts merged as desired.**",

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application.
