Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Conversation Summary\n\n**Problem Identified:** \n\n* Johnkennyuk was unable to link his Pieces accounts using his Github and Google accounts, despite having been registered for some time. This is likely due to the different capitalization of the first letter in his emails associated with each platform, as well as a legacy system limitation handled by a soon-to-be-replaced auth provider.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n* Reset and merge accounts, either by linking manually through a phone call with Pieces support or using a screen recording.\n* Implement a new authentication service provider that can link accounts with varying emails.\n\n**Solution Implemented (Partially):**\n\n* Pieces team reset johnkennyuk's Github user.\n* The old auth service is still in use and couldn't link accounts due to the capitalization difference in email addresses.\n\n**Solution Implementation Timeline:**\n* The new auth service is expected in early/mid-march 2025.\n\n**Current Outcome:**\n\n* Temporary fix implemented, awaiting new authentication system in March to attempt linking again and avoid the capitalization mismatch issue entirely\n\n**User Suggestion (Postpone Linking, Await New Service)**\n\n* Due to repeated failures and the imminent arrival of the improved auth system, johnkennyuk opted to delay the linking process until March.\n* Pieces support acknowledged and confirmed the delay, indicating they'll resume support when new system is ready.\n\nThis summarization focuses mainly on the key aspects and problems addressed, solutions, current situation,  and future steps, as instructed. It also condenses extraneous and redundant parts of the conversation without obscuring important details for a concise overview of the issue, attempts at solutions, and its status.",

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance. Thanks!\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Rohan Rathi (@rohanrathi99) is experiencing issues with making requests to Pieces' cloud services and local models.\n* The problem appears to be related to a firewall or network configuration that is blocking outgoing requests.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Logs provided by Rohan did not reveal any obvious cause for the issues.\n* Further investigation was needed to determine the root cause of the problem.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* After reviewing the logs, Mark from Pieces (@mark-at-pieces) suggested scheduling a call for further troubleshooting.\n* Rohan scheduled a meeting for February 25th to investigate the issue further.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* During the meeting, the issue with cloud LLMs was identified as being caused by a personal OpenApi key. This was resolved by removing the key.\n* The issue with local LLMs was likely due to hardware constraints. This was resolved by using a smaller local LLM.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation began on February 16th, 2025.\n* The issue was resolved on February 25th, 2025.",

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue.

This was resolved by removing the key.\n* The issue with local LLMs was likely due to hardware constraints.

My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**User:** johnkennyuk\n\n**Problem:** Ollama server installed with Pieces OS conflicts with their existing Ollama installation, causing CUDA errors.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User used Winget to install Ollama originally.\n* Uninstalling and reinstalling Ollama and Pieces OS multiple times did not resolve the issue.\n* Errors occurred when Pieces OS attempted to start its own Ollama instance.\n* User suspected the issue was related to startup order.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Author suggested uninstalling Ollama and reinstalling using the OllamaSetup.exe installer.\n* Author offered to help debug the issue on a video call.\n* User eventually resolved the issue through multiple uninstalls and path cleanups.\n* Author pushed a change in Pieces OS version 11.1.2 to address potential race conditions.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User reported the issue was resolved, but later experienced it again.\n* Author suggested a video call to investigate further.\n* User requested future versions of Pieces OS detect and handle existing Ollama installations.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue was likely caused by a conflict between the two Ollama installations and the startup order of Pieces OS.\n* The author of Pieces OS was helpful in providing solutions and debugging the issue.\n* The user's request for improved handling of existing Ollama installations is a valid suggestion for future development.",
