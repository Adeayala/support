Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Conversation Summary on Account Linking Issue:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* John identified an issue with account linking failing despite having distinct accounts for Google and Github.\n* John needs his personal domain (set on Google account) to be the main account.\n* He wants to avoid unnecessary calls due to his technical expertise.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow is subpar and not user-friendly.\n* Bug related to separate accounts registered earlier with capital letter mismatch in Google vs Github email address.\n* New system is being developed to resolve these issues.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark suggested merging accounts into John's primary domain (Google) through Github/Google account linking flow.\n* John was encouraged to try screen recording the flow for better troubleshooting.\n* Mark proposed a tentative solution of resetting Github account and temporarily disabling Github email privacy setting.\n* Mark also recommended waiting for the new system to be implemented as it will address these issues.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Account merging failed due to persistent email capitalization issue.\n* Implementation of new system was pushed to early/mid March due to other product release priorities.\n* John will be informed again when the new system is closer to release.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Existing system uses an old authentication service provider with limitations, prompting a migration to a new one that will handle account linking more effectively.\n* Waiting for the new system might be the best course of action to resolve the issue conclusively.",
