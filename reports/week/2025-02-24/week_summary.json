Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User (@johnkennyuk) is unable to merge their personal and Github accounts in Pieces app.\n* The current account linking flow is not user-friendly.\n* The user has two separate accounts registered with different email addresses (one with a capital letter).\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Merge the two accounts under the user's Google account.\n* The user was asked to sign out and then sign back in with their Github account to trigger the linking flow.\n* The user's Github account was reset multiple times.\n* The user's email privacy setting on Github was temporarily disabled.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* The account linking flow is not intuitive.\n* A single character capitalization difference in email addresses is preventing the accounts from being merged.\n* The development of a new auth service is underway, which will allow for more flexibility in account linking.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The user opted to wait for the new auth service to be released before attempting to merge their accounts again.\n* The new auth service is expected to be ready in early/mid March 2025.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The user's Github account was reset again on February 23, 2025.\n* The user will be notified when the new auth service is available and will be given priority for testing the new linking flow.\n\n**Overall, the issue remains unresolved, but a solution is expected to be available soon.**",

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance. Thanks!\n## GitHub Issue Summary: Rohanrathi99's Network Issues\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Rohanrathi99 is experiencing issues making requests to PiecesOS cloud services and using local models.\n* Mark-at-pieces, the Pieces support representative, requested log files for further investigation.\n* Rohanrathi99 provided the requested log files.\n* Mark-at-pieces identified two issues:\n    * Cloud LLM issue caused by a personal OpenApi key (resolved by removing the key)\n    * Local LLM issue likely due to hardware constraints (resolved by using a smaller local LLM)\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Firewall or network configuration blocking PiecesOS outgoing requests.\n* Hardware constraints impacting local LLM performance.\n\n**Solutions Implemented:**\n\n* Removal of the personal OpenApi key.\n* Utilization of a smaller local LLM.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Both cloud and local LLM issues have been resolved.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* A call was scheduled between Rohanrathi99 and Mark-at-pieces for further discussion and troubleshooting.\n* The issue was closed after successful resolution.",
