Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk is experiencing issues with linking his Github and Google accounts in the Pieces app.\n* The current account linking flow is not working properly and is not straightforward.\n* Johnkennyuk prefers to keep his personal domain attached to his Google account as the main account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is buggy and not user-friendly.\n* There seems to be a case sensitivity issue with email addresses during linking.\n* Johnkennyuk's original registration with the app caused the separate accounts issue.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark, a Pieces support representative, offered to manually merge the accounts and guide Johnkennyuk through the process.\n* They attempted to troubleshoot the issue by resetting Johnkennyuk's Github account and addressing the case sensitivity issue.\n* A new account linking system is under development and is expected to be released in early/mid March.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is not yet resolved due to the case sensitivity problem and the upcoming release of the new account linking system.\n* Johnkennyuk has agreed to wait for the new system and will be given priority access for testing it.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The Pieces team is actively working on a replacement for the current account linking system.\n* This issue is related to other issues reported by users, such as the inability to generate personal shareable links.\n* The development team is confident that the new system will address the current issues and provide a smoother user experience.",

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance.

However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance. Thanks!\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary: Rohanrathi99's Network Issue\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Rohanrathi99 reported experiencing network issues with both cloud and local LLMs.\n* They provided log files for analysis.\n* A call was scheduled to investigate the issue further.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Cloud LLM issue: Usage of a personal OpenApi key.\n* Local LLM issue: Likely hardware constraints.\n\n**Solutions Implemented:**\n\n* Cloud LLM: Removed the personal OpenApi key.\n* Local LLM: Used a smaller local LLM.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issues with both cloud and local LLMs have been resolved.\n\n\n**Note:** The actual resolution details were provided during the scheduled call on February 25, 2025.",
