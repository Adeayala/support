Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of Pieces Support GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Problem:** John Kenny (@johnkennyuk) is unable to link his GitHub and Google accounts in the Pieces app. This prevents him from fully utilizing the app's functionalities.\n\n**Proposed Solutions:**\n\n* **Mark (Pieces Support Team):**\n    * Offered to merge John's accounts manually.\n    * Suggested a workaround involving linking the accounts through a screen recording.\n    * Proposed a potential solution involving capitalizing the first letter of the email address in the GitHub account to match the Google account.\n    * Recommended waiting for the new auth service provider launch in late February/early March.\n\n* **John:**\n    * Agreed to Mark's suggestions.\n    * Offered to wait for the new auth service provider launch.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n* Mark is still working on the new auth service provider, which is expected to be ready in early/mid March.\n* John is waiting for the new system to be implemented.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is not currently resolved.\n* John will wait for the new auth service provider to be launched and attempt to link his accounts again.\n* Mark will follow up with John when the new system is ready.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The old auth service provider has limitations that cause issues with linking accounts with slight variations, such as capitalization differences.\n* The new auth service provider is expected to address these issues and allow for more flexible account linking.",

My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* **johnkennyuk** was experiencing Cuda errors with Ollama on Pieces OS.\n* The errors were related to `cublas64_12.dll` and only occurred with Pieces OS's Ollama Server instances.\n* **johnkennyuk** suspected a bad installation or corrupt files.\n* Startup order was considered as a potential issue.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Incomplete or broken Ollama installation.\n* Path issues referencing the wrong installation.\n* Race condition between Pieces OS and the external Ollama app causing startup conflicts.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Uninstalling and reinstalling Ollama and Pieces OS.\n* Cleaning up the PATH environment variables.\n* Pushing a change in Pieces OS version 11.1.2 to address the race condition.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* **johnkennyuk** reported that the issue was resolved after several uninstalls and path cleanups.\n* However, the issue reappeared after updates.\n* **brian-at-pieces** suggested updating to version 11.1.2 and scheduling a call to further investigate the issue.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* **johnkennyuk** proposed adding functionality to Pieces OS for detecting and managing external Ollama app instances.\n* **brian-at-pieces** confirmed that Pieces OS can detect and interact with external Ollama installations.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe issue appears to be resolved for now, but further investigation is needed to ensure it doesn't resurface. Implementing the proposed functionality for managing external Ollama instances could provide a long-term solution.",
