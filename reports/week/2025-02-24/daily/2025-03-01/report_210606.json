Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Key points raised:\n\n* The existing account linking flow is not user-friendly and needs improvement.\n* The user (johnkennyuk) is experiencing issues linking their GitHub and Google accounts.\n* The user prefers to keep their Google account as the main account.\n* There is a potential issue with capitalization in email addresses causing the linking to fail.\n\n## Problems identified:\n\n* Existing account linking flow is problematic.\n* Potential capitalization issue with email addresses.\n\n## Solutions proposed/implemented:\n\n* Replace current auth service with a new one by the end of the month.\n* Manually merging user accounts on a temporary basis.\n* Resetting user's GitHub account.\n\n## Current status/outcome:\n\n* New auth service is still under development with a revised timeline of early/mid March.\n* User is waiting for the new system to be implemented before attempting to relink their accounts.\n\n## Additional notes:\n\n* The user has been experiencing the issue for some time due to bugs in earlier versions of the application.\n* Once the new auth service is implemented, it should be possible to link accounts that differ in email case.",

My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation about Ollama Installation Issues in Pieces OS\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **Problem:** User (@johnkennyuk) had issues with Ollama on Pieces OS, specifically Cuda errors and conflicts with external Ollama instances.\n* **Troubleshooting:** \n    * Initial advice included uninstalling and reinstalling Ollama using specific methods.\n    * Further analysis suggested investigating `ollama_llama_server.exe` and incomplete installations.\n    * Path cleanup and multiple uninstalls eventually resolved the issue temporarily.\n* **Outcome:** The cause of the problem remains unclear, but a potential race condition was identified.\n    * A fix was implemented in Pieces OS version 11.1.2.\n    * The issue resurfaced despite the update, requiring further investigation.\n\n**Current status:**\n\n* The user is experiencing the issue again after updating to v11.1.2.\n* The problem is likely related to a race condition between Pieces OS and external Ollama instances.\n* Further investigation and communication with the developer (@brian-at-pieces) are needed.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n* Update Pieces OS to the latest version.\n* Contact the developer for further assistance.\n* Consider alternative solutions, such as disabling Ollama launch on Pieces OS startup.\n\n**Unresolved issues:**\n\n* The root cause of the race condition remains unclear.\n* A definitive solution for preventing the conflict has not been implemented.",

    "**Prioritize Account Linking Improvements:** The inability to link multiple accounts, particularly GitHub and Google, is a recurring issue. Focus on resolving this by thoroughly testing the new authentication service before release.",
    "**Investigate Ollama Conflicts:** Pieces OS starting its own Ollama instance instead of using an externally installed one is causing CUDA errors. Identify the root cause of this conflict and provide a solution, such as a configuration option to disable the internal Ollama instance.",
    "**Improve Communication on Existing Issues:**  Keep users informed about the progress of the new authentication service and any potential workarounds for the Ollama conflict.  Clear communication can significantly impact user satisfaction."
