| [#610](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/610) | Pieces Desktop app, account linking never acheived for several years? | 8.01 |
| [#570](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/570) | Pieces OS conflicting with Installed Ollama Server? | 4.35 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Account Linking and Ollama Integration Issues
Users report problems linking GitHub and Google accounts, with only one connectable at a time. This might be due to email capitalization inconsistencies. Additionally, Pieces OS conflicts with externally installed Ollama instances, causing CUDA errors. Potential solutions include a new authentication service and resolving race conditions.

**Related Issues:**
- [#610](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/610): Pieces Desktop app, account linking never acheived for several years?
- [#570](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/570): Pieces OS conflicting with Installed Ollama Server?


## Recommendations
- **Prioritize Account Linking Improvements:** The inability to link multiple accounts, particularly GitHub and Google, is a recurring issue. Focus on resolving this by thoroughly testing the new authentication service before release.
- **Investigate Ollama Conflicts:** Pieces OS starting its own Ollama instance instead of using an externally installed one is causing CUDA errors. Identify the root cause of this conflict and provide a solution, such as a configuration option to disable the internal Ollama instance.
- **Improve Communication on Existing Issues:**  Keep users informed about the progress of the new authentication service and any potential workarounds for the Ollama conflict.  Clear communication can significantly impact user satisfaction.
