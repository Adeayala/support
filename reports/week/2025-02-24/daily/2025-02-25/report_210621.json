However, for the last 2\u20133 weeks, the application has stopped working. Whenever I enter a prompt, I receive the following message:  \n\n> *\"I'm sorry, we're having trouble reaching our cloud services. This is likely due to an issue with your local network, such as limited connectivity. Try checking your internet connection or switching your network, then try again. If that doesn't work, please contact support.\"*  \n\nI have verified my internet connection and tried switching networks, but the issue persists. Additionally, when I attempted to use a local LLM (Ollama) and different LLM aswell, I encountered the same error message, indicating that the problem is not limited to cloud services.  \n\nI would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. If a fix is not available, I may need to uninstall the application. I have attached relevant screenshots for reference.  \n\n**System Information:**  \n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Pieces OS Version: v11.1.2\n- Pieces for Developer Version: v3.3.7 \n- Network Status: Stable / Switched Networks  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open *Pieces for Developers*.  \n2. Enter a prompt.  \n3. Observe the error message regarding cloud service connectivity.  \n4. Attempt to use a local LLM (Ollama) and receive the same message.  \n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nThe application should process prompts as expected, either via cloud services or local LLMs.  \n\n**Attachments:**  \n[Attach screenshots here] \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157e569c-042f-4833-aa67-2bbd2f657f1d)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fdf544-8465-45c2-a906-1e492d6533e4)\n \n\nLooking forward to your assistance. Thanks!\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Rohanrathi99 reported issues with making requests to Pieces cloud services and local models.\n* Mark-at-Pieces suspected firewall or network configuration issues and requested log files.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Firewall or network configuration might be blocking outgoing requests.\n* Local model issues might be due to hardware constraints.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Rohanrathi99 provided log files for investigation.\n* Mark-at-Pieces investigated the logs and identified two issues:\n    * Cloud LLM issue caused by a personal OpenApi key (resolved by removing the key).\n    * Local LLM issue likely due to hardware constraints (resolved by using a smaller local model).\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Both cloud and local LLM issues are resolved.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* A meeting was scheduled to discuss the issues further and identify the root cause.\n* The issue was resolved before the meeting took place.",
