## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces for Developers Launch and Connectivity Issues
Users report Pieces for Developers failing to launch or connect to cloud/local LLMs. This might be due to firewall configurations, conflicting installations (e.g., Microsoft Store vs. EXE), hardware limitations with local LLMs, or PiecesOS startup issues. Solutions include checking firewall settings, removing duplicate installations, using smaller local models, and managing PiecesOS startup behavior.
