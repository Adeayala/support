## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolution of Pieces OS launch and connectivity issues:** This is the most common issue reported by users, impacting both Pieces for Developers and Pieces OS on Linux and Windows. Focus on resolving conflicts with OneDrive, dependency errors, and cloud service connectivity problems.
- **Improve Ollama integration with Pieces OS:** Address installation failures, CUDA errors, and conflicts with existing Ollama installations to ensure a smoother user experience.
- **Investigate and resolve account linking issues:** Address the legacy system limitations preventing users from linking multiple accounts, particularly the email discrepancy issue. The implementation of the new authentication service in March should be a high priority.
- **Address bugs in the JetBrains plugin and Pieces app:** Focus on resolving horizontal scrolling issues in code snippets, cursor visibility problems in the Copilot chat, and difficulties connecting to cloud services and local LLMs.
- **Proactively monitor and address issues reported in the most active tickets:** This will help identify and resolve emerging issues quickly and efficiently.
- **Improve communication with users regarding ongoing issues and expected resolution times:** Keep users informed about the progress being made on resolving known issues and provide clear timelines for when they can expect a fix. This will help manage user expectations and reduce frustration.
- **Develop and maintain comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides:** Provide users with easy-to-understand resources that can help them resolve common issues on their own. This will reduce the number of support tickets submitted and free up support staff to focus on more complex issues.
- **Gather user feedback on support experiences and identify areas for improvement:** Regularly solicit feedback from users on their support experiences to identify areas where the support process can be improved. This could include feedback on response times, communication clarity, and the helpfulness of provided solutions.
