- **Investigate PiecesOS/Desktop App Launch Errors:** Analyze the root causes behind the "PiecesOS was unable to launch" error and connection issues, particularly on startup. Review dependencies, log files, and startup configurations across Windows and Linux.
- **Enhance Pieces for Developers Stability:** Address the reported functionality issues, including horizontal scrolling problems, cursor visibility in the Copilot chat window, and difficulties accessing cloud services and local LLMs. Prioritize bug fixes and software updates.
- **Proactive Communication:**  Keep users informed about ongoing investigations and expected resolution timelines for common issues, especially those related to Ollama integration and account linking. This could involve updating relevant support articles or forum threads.
- **Gather Detailed Logs and System Information:** Encourage users to provide comprehensive logs and system information when reporting issues, particularly for complex problems like Ollama conflicts and launch errors. This will expedite troubleshooting and resolution.
- **Develop Troubleshooting Guides:** Create detailed troubleshooting guides for common issues, such as Ollama integration problems and PiecesOS launch errors. These guides should include step-by-step instructions, potential workarounds, and tips for gathering relevant logs.
