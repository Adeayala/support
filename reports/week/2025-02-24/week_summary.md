## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolution of Pieces OS launch issues:** This is a critical issue affecting multiple users and hindering their ability to use the software. Focus on identifying the root causes, whether it's OneDrive conflicts, duplicate installations, or other factors, and provide clear solutions.
- **Improve Ollama integration and troubleshooting:** Address the recurring issues with Ollama server integration, including Cuda errors and installation problems. Provide clearer instructions, investigate potential conflicts, and ensure compatibility with different hardware configurations.
- **Enhance communication and documentation:** Provide users with more detailed guidance on troubleshooting common issues, including network connectivity problems, account linking errors, and software conflicts. Update documentation and FAQs to reflect these solutions.
- **Investigate and address JetBrains plugin bugs:** Resolve the reported issues with horizontal scrolling, cursor visibility, and connectivity within the JetBrains plugin to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **Gather more detailed user feedback:** Encourage users to provide comprehensive information when reporting issues, including system specifications, steps to reproduce the problem, and any error messages encountered. This will help in faster diagnosis and resolution.
- **Consider implementing a system for detecting and utilizing external Ollama App instances:** This would allow users to leverage their existing Ollama installations and potentially avoid conflicts with the Pieces OS built-in version.
- **Investigate the feasibility of a more robust account linking system:** Address the long-standing issue of account linking difficulties, potentially by revamping the linking process or exploring alternative authentication methods.
- **Continue monitoring and addressing issues related to new features:** As new features are released, pay close attention to user feedback and support tickets to identify and address any teething problems promptly.
- **Proactively communicate known issues and workarounds:** Maintain a public-facing list of known issues and workarounds to keep users informed and minimize frustration while waiting for permanent solutions.
- **Analyze support ticket trends:** Regularly analyze support ticket data to identify recurring issues, common pain points, and areas where documentation or software improvements are needed. This data-driven approach will help prioritize development efforts and enhance the overall user experience.
