## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving Pieces OS and Desktop App integration issues:** This is the most frequent problem category with high activity levels. Focus on improving account linking, dependency connections, and third-party tool installations.
- **Investigate and fix JetBrains plugin UI bugs:** Address the horizontal scrolling and cursor visibility issues to improve user experience in code review and Copilot interaction.
- **Improve Ollama integration and installation experience:** Address conflicts with external Ollama installations and streamline the installation process to prevent issues and user frustration.
- **Monitor and address the account linking issue:** While a new system is under development, continue to monitor and address issues with the current system to minimize user impact.
- **Gather more data on Linux-specific issues:** While only one ticket mentioned Linux, the "Invalid port" issue suggests potential platform-specific problems. Gather more data to understand and address these issues effectively.
- **Proactively communicate known issues and workarounds:** Keep users informed about the status of known issues, especially the account linking problem and the upcoming new system. Provide clear workarounds to minimize disruption.
- **Consider expanding support channels:** Offering support through GitHub and Discord is helpful, but some users may prefer alternative channels like live chat or email. Explore expanding support options to cater to diverse preferences.
