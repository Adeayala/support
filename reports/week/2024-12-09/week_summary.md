## Recommendations
- **Prioritize Onboarding Issues:** The most frequent and active tickets revolve around onboarding problems across macOS and the desktop app. Focus on resolving these issues to ensure a smooth initial user experience.
- **Investigate and Fix Copilot Errors:** Many users report issues with Pieces OS Copilot, including display glitches and "Context exceeded" errors. Address these problems to improve Copilot's reliability and functionality.
- **Address Windows Desktop App Problems:** Users experience white screens and crashes on the Windows desktop app. Prioritize resolving these issues to ensure stability and functionality on Windows.
- **Improve Error Messaging:** Vague error messages like "Something went wrong with processing" frustrate users. Provide more specific error messages to help users understand and potentially resolve issues themselves.
- **Gather More Information on Tricky Issues:** For issues like file/folder uploads causing crashes, request specific files/folders from users to reproduce and debug effectively.
- **Consider User Interface Improvements:** Issues related to window resizing and button visibility on smaller screens highlight the need for UI improvements to accommodate various screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Review and Update Documentation:** Ensure that documentation and support resources are up-to-date, especially regarding onboarding, Copilot usage, and troubleshooting common errors.
- **Monitor and Analyze Ticket Trends:** Regularly analyze support ticket data to identify recurring issues, emerging trends, and areas for improvement in the software or support processes.
