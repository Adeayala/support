## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving Pieces OS 10.1.15 bugs:** This version has the most reported issues, impacting user experience across multiple features (right tray icons, demo chats, Copilot responses).
- **Investigate and address onboarding issues:** Problems with onboarding, including blank demo chats and 'Context Exceeded' errors, are causing user frustration early on. Resolving these will improve user adoption and satisfaction.
- **Provide clear workarounds for Claude LLM context errors:** While a fix is planned, offer users temporary solutions like using alternative LLMs or breaking down prompts.
- **Improve Pieces OS stability and launch process:** Address issues with Pieces OS getting stuck on "Connecting..." or failing to launch, especially for the desktop app and VS Code extension. This may involve investigating firewall conflicts, update processes, and providing clearer error messages.
- **Gather more information on Desktop App crashes:** Request detailed logs from users experiencing crashes and white screens on Windows 11 to help developers identify the root cause and implement a fix.
- **Review and update documentation:** Ensure troubleshooting steps for common issues are up-to-date and easy to find. This includes information on resetting Pieces, resolving firewall issues, and understanding onboarding processes.
- **Consider creating a dedicated FAQ for Pieces OS 10.1.15:** Given the number of issues reported, a dedicated FAQ section can centralize troubleshooting information and reduce support ticket volume.
- **Monitor and analyze ticket trends:** Regularly analyze support tickets to identify recurring issues and prioritize development efforts based on user impact and frequency.
