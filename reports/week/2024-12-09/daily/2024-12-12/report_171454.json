Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url. I tried navigating manually to the url opened by the launch button in Visual Studio [(url)](http://localhost:1000/?application=%7B%22name%22%3A%22VISUAL_STUDIO%22%2C%22platform%22%3A%22WINDOWS%22%2C%22privacy%22%3A%22OPEN%22%2C%22capabilities%22%3A%22BLENDED%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22MANUAL%22%2C%22schema%22%3A%7B%22semantic%22%3A%22MAJOR_0_MINOR_0_PATCH_1%22%2C%22migration%22%3A0%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%229ab3c1de-0625-408e-8d42-8e2c48e11d0c%22%2C%22version%22%3A%223.0.0%22%2C%22onboarded%22%3Afalse%2C%22automaticUnload%22%3Afalse%7D&capabilities=1048575&theme=%7B%22darkMode%22%3Atrue%2C%22scaffoldBackgroundColor%22%3A-14737633%2C%22primary%22%3A-328966%2C%22secondary%22%3A-14737633%2C%22onPrimary%22%3A-10724260%2C%22onSecondary%22%3A-328966%2C%22primaryContainer%22%3A-13421773%2C%22surface%22%3A-13750738%2C%22onSurface%22%3A-328966%2C%22error%22%3A-934979%2C%22onError%22%3A-1%7D) and the response is \"Route not found\".\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[log-11252024.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903747/log-11252024.txt)\n[applications.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903752/applications.txt)\n\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n### Key Points:\n\n* Andrea3i reported the OS toolbar in Pieces not launching.\n* The Visual Studio plugin and Pieces OS versions were updated, but the issue persisted.\n* The problem seems to stem from an OS error occurring when trying to host applets.\n* Pieces team is investigating and needs more information from Andrea3i to diagnose the root cause.\n\n### Problems Identified:\n\n* OS toolbar not launching.\n* Pieces OS restarts unexpectedly.\n* Clicking the system tray icon doesn't do anything.\n\n### Proposed/Implemented Solutions:\n\n* Released Visual Studio plugin version 3.0.1 to address UI thread hang.\n* Scheduled to release Pieces OS version 10.1.15 with changes to how ports are chosen for tool windows.\n* Proposed scheduling a meeting with Andrea3i for further debugging.\n* Requested running a utility to retrieve the OS error code for diagnosis.\n\n### Current Status/Outcome:\n\n* Issue remains unresolved.\n* Investigating the OS error causing the applets not to be hosted.\n* Need more information from Andrea3i to determine root cause.",
