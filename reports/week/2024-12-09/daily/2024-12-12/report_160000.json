Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url. I tried navigating manually to the url opened by the launch button in Visual Studio [(url)](http://localhost:1000/?application=%7B%22name%22%3A%22VISUAL_STUDIO%22%2C%22platform%22%3A%22WINDOWS%22%2C%22privacy%22%3A%22OPEN%22%2C%22capabilities%22%3A%22BLENDED%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22MANUAL%22%2C%22schema%22%3A%7B%22semantic%22%3A%22MAJOR_0_MINOR_0_PATCH_1%22%2C%22migration%22%3A0%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%229ab3c1de-0625-408e-8d42-8e2c48e11d0c%22%2C%22version%22%3A%223.0.0%22%2C%22onboarded%22%3Afalse%2C%22automaticUnload%22%3Afalse%7D&capabilities=1048575&theme=%7B%22darkMode%22%3Atrue%2C%22scaffoldBackgroundColor%22%3A-14737633%2C%22primary%22%3A-328966%2C%22secondary%22%3A-14737633%2C%22onPrimary%22%3A-10724260%2C%22onSecondary%22%3A-328966%2C%22primaryContainer%22%3A-13421773%2C%22surface%22%3A-13750738%2C%22onSurface%22%3A-328966%2C%22error%22%3A-934979%2C%22onError%22%3A-1%7D) and the response is \"Route not found\".\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[log-11252024.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903747/log-11252024.txt)\n[applications.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903752/applications.txt)\n\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* The OS server toolbar is not launching correctly.\n* The Visual Studio plugin fails to launch Pieces OS.\n* The system tray icon doesn't work.\n* Pieces OS restarts on its own occasionally.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Issue with Pieces OS version 10.1.0.\n* Issue with Visual Studio plugin version 3.0.0.\n* Underlying OS error preventing applets from launching.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Hotfix release of Visual Studio plugin version 3.0.1.\n* Planned release of Pieces OS version 10.1.15 with bug fixes.\n* Debugging session scheduled with the user.\n* Running a utility to obtain the OS error code.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The proposed solutions haven't fully resolved the issue for the user.\n* More investigation is needed to determine the root cause of the OS error.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user provided a log file for further analysis.\n* The developers suspect possible issues with IPv6 support, firewall restrictions, or account/group policy restrictions.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n* The developers need to analyze the OS error code to diagnose the underlying problem.\n* They should schedule a debugging session with the user to gather more information.\n* Investigate potential causes like IPv6 support, firewall settings, and account permissions.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolving 'Pieces OS and VS Extension Launch Failure'**: This issue is causing significant user frustration and impacting core product functionality. Focus development resources on identifying the root cause and implementing a permanent fix.",
    "**Improve error messaging and logging**: The current error messages ('Sentry Error Event', 'route not found') are not informative enough for users or developers to diagnose the problem. Enhance error handling to provide more specific details about the issue, including relevant error codes and potential solutions.",
    "**Investigate potential environmental factors**: Explore if issues like IPv6 support, firewall restrictions, or account/group policy restrictions are contributing to the launch failures. Provide clear guidance to users on how to configure their environments for optimal Pieces OS and VS Extension compatibility.",
    "**Enhance communication and transparency**: Keep users informed about the progress of bug fixes and new releases. Provide clear timelines for resolution and proactively communicate any workarounds or temporary solutions.",
    "**Consider a dedicated support channel for P0 issues**: Given the severity of P0 issues, establish a dedicated support channel with faster response times and prioritized attention from senior support engineers.",
    "**Develop automated tests to prevent regressions**: Implement automated testing to catch similar issues early in the development cycle and prevent regressions in future releases.",
    "**Gather more data on affected user environments**: Collect information about the operating systems, Visual Studio versions, and network configurations of users experiencing the launch failures. This data can help identify patterns and potential causes.",
    "**Create a knowledge base article or FAQ**:  Publish a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for 'Pieces OS and VS Extension Launch Failure' that includes common symptoms, potential causes, and step-by-step solutions. This will empower users to self-resolve the issue and reduce support ticket volume."
