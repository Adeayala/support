Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url. I tried navigating manually to the url opened by the launch button in Visual Studio [(url)](http://localhost:1000/?application=%7B%22name%22%3A%22VISUAL_STUDIO%22%2C%22platform%22%3A%22WINDOWS%22%2C%22privacy%22%3A%22OPEN%22%2C%22capabilities%22%3A%22BLENDED%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22MANUAL%22%2C%22schema%22%3A%7B%22semantic%22%3A%22MAJOR_0_MINOR_0_PATCH_1%22%2C%22migration%22%3A0%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%229ab3c1de-0625-408e-8d42-8e2c48e11d0c%22%2C%22version%22%3A%223.0.0%22%2C%22onboarded%22%3Afalse%2C%22automaticUnload%22%3Afalse%7D&capabilities=1048575&theme=%7B%22darkMode%22%3Atrue%2C%22scaffoldBackgroundColor%22%3A-14737633%2C%22primary%22%3A-328966%2C%22secondary%22%3A-14737633%2C%22onPrimary%22%3A-10724260%2C%22onSecondary%22%3A-328966%2C%22primaryContainer%22%3A-13421773%2C%22surface%22%3A-13750738%2C%22onSurface%22%3A-328966%2C%22error%22%3A-934979%2C%22onError%22%3A-1%7D) and the response is \"Route not found\".\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[log-11252024.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903747/log-11252024.txt)\n[applications.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903752/applications.txt)\n\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* The OS server toolbar is not launching correctly, causing issues for the user.\n* The user tried launching the toolbar from various ways but nothing worked.\n* The user reported the toolbar restarting on its own and applets not working.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* A P0 (critical priority) issue with version 3.0.0 of the Visual Studio plugin during initialization.\n* An issue with Pieces OS trying to host applets, possibly related to an OS error.\n* The Dart language sdk not returning the actual OS error code.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Hotfix released for Visual Studio plugin version 3.0.1 (to resolve UI thread hang).\n* Pieces OS version 10.1.15 released with changes on how ports are chosen for tool window integrations.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The initial solution did not fully resolve the user's issues.\n* Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause of applet problems and the OS error.\n* User is requested to schedule debugging session to investigate the issue further.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The conversation took place in November 2024, so the information might be outdated.\n* It's unclear if the proposed solutions fully resolved the identified issues.",
