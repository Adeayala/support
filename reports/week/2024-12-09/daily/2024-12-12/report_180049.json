Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url. I tried navigating manually to the url opened by the launch button in Visual Studio [(url)](http://localhost:1000/?application=%7B%22name%22%3A%22VISUAL_STUDIO%22%2C%22platform%22%3A%22WINDOWS%22%2C%22privacy%22%3A%22OPEN%22%2C%22capabilities%22%3A%22BLENDED%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22MANUAL%22%2C%22schema%22%3A%7B%22semantic%22%3A%22MAJOR_0_MINOR_0_PATCH_1%22%2C%22migration%22%3A0%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%229ab3c1de-0625-408e-8d42-8e2c48e11d0c%22%2C%22version%22%3A%223.0.0%22%2C%22onboarded%22%3Afalse%2C%22automaticUnload%22%3Afalse%7D&capabilities=1048575&theme=%7B%22darkMode%22%3Atrue%2C%22scaffoldBackgroundColor%22%3A-14737633%2C%22primary%22%3A-328966%2C%22secondary%22%3A-14737633%2C%22onPrimary%22%3A-10724260%2C%22onSecondary%22%3A-328966%2C%22primaryContainer%22%3A-13421773%2C%22surface%22%3A-13750738%2C%22onSurface%22%3A-328966%2C%22error%22%3A-934979%2C%22onError%22%3A-1%7D) and the response is \"Route not found\".\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[log-11252024.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903747/log-11252024.txt)\n[applications.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903752/applications.txt)\n\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* The OS toolbar fails to launch when trying to launch the Visual Studio plugin.\n* The issue seems to be related to version 3.0.0 of the Visual Studio plugin.\n* The user also experiences issues with the toolbar not launching from other methods, unexpected restarts of Pieces OS, and no response when clicking the system tray icon.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Issue with version 3.0.0 of the Visual Studio plugin causing UI thread hang.\n* Pieces OS trying to host applets throws an OS error due to missing error code in Dart language sdk.\n* Potential problems include lack of IPv6 support, firewall restrictions, account permission or Group policy restrictions.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Hotfix for Visual Studio plugin version 3.0.1 released to resolve UI thread hang.\n* Pieces OS version 10.1.15 released with changes to port selection for webview integrations.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue persists despite the released versions.\n* Further debugging and gathering of information is needed to identify the root cause.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* User will schedule a time with mark-at-pieces for further debugging.\n* A utility will be run to retrieve the OS error code for more information.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of clear communication and collaboration between users and developers.\n* The issue seems complex and requires further investigation to resolve.",
