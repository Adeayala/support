| [#527](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/527) | Manually downloading a LLM | 3.15 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Local LLM download fails or is not recognized
Users with unstable internet connections experience difficulties downloading large LLM files. Download interruptions require restarting the process. Manually downloading the files doesn't solve the issue, as the application doesn't recognize them, even when placed in the correct directory. Editing the database to reflect the download doesn't work either.

- **Consider Download Managers:** Explore the feasibility of integrating download manager functionality or recommending reputable third-party download managers to users. This can provide better control and reliability for large file downloads.
- **Gather User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users experiencing download issues to understand their specific challenges and identify areas for improvement in the download process and user interface.
- **Prioritize Ticket Resolution:** With a growing user base, prioritize timely resolution of open tickets, especially those related to critical functionality like LLM downloads, to ensure user satisfaction and minimize disruption.
- **Improve Error Messaging:** Provide more informative and user-friendly error messages when LLM downloads fail or are not recognized. Clearly guide users on how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
- **Test on Various Networks:** Conduct thorough testing of the LLM download process on various network conditions (stable, unstable, low bandwidth) to identify and address potential issues related to different internet connections.
- **Automate Support Tasks:** Explore opportunities to automate repetitive support tasks, such as providing initial responses to common queries or routing tickets to the appropriate teams, to improve efficiency.
- **Collect Data on Download Failures:** Implement logging and tracking mechanisms to gather detailed information about LLM download failures, including error codes, network conditions, and user actions. This data can help diagnose and resolve issues more effectively.
