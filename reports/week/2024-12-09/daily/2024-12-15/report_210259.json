      "description": "Users with unstable internet connections experience difficulties downloading large LLM files. Download interruptions require restarting the process. Manually downloading the files doesn't solve the issue, as the application doesn't recognize them, even when placed in the correct directory. Editing the database to reflect the download doesn't work either.",

Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\nNo comments found on this issue.",
