Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url. I tried navigating manually to the url opened by the launch button in Visual Studio [(url)](http://localhost:1000/?application=%7B%22name%22%3A%22VISUAL_STUDIO%22%2C%22platform%22%3A%22WINDOWS%22%2C%22privacy%22%3A%22OPEN%22%2C%22capabilities%22%3A%22BLENDED%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22MANUAL%22%2C%22schema%22%3A%7B%22semantic%22%3A%22MAJOR_0_MINOR_0_PATCH_1%22%2C%22migration%22%3A0%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%229ab3c1de-0625-408e-8d42-8e2c48e11d0c%22%2C%22version%22%3A%223.0.0%22%2C%22onboarded%22%3Afalse%2C%22automaticUnload%22%3Afalse%7D&capabilities=1048575&theme=%7B%22darkMode%22%3Atrue%2C%22scaffoldBackgroundColor%22%3A-14737633%2C%22primary%22%3A-328966%2C%22secondary%22%3A-14737633%2C%22onPrimary%22%3A-10724260%2C%22onSecondary%22%3A-328966%2C%22primaryContainer%22%3A-13421773%2C%22surface%22%3A-13750738%2C%22onSurface%22%3A-328966%2C%22error%22%3A-934979%2C%22onError%22%3A-1%7D) and the response is \"Route not found\".\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[log-11252024.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903747/log-11252024.txt)\n[applications.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903752/applications.txt)\n\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Andrea3i reported that the OS toolbar is not launching.\n* The issue was initially thought to be related to the Visual Studio plugin.\n* Further investigation revealed a deeper problem with how applets are hosted.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The Visual Studio plugin was causing a UI thread hang.\n* Pieces OS couldn't choose the correct ports to serve the webviews.\n* Dart language SDK wasn't returning the actual OS error code.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Released Visual Studio plugin version 3.0.1 to fix the UI thread hang.\n* Released Pieces OS version 10.1.15 to improve port selection for webviews.\n* Scheduled a screen recording with Andrea3i to gather more information.\n* Requested Andrea3i to run a utility to retrieve the OS error code.\n* Investigated potential issues like lack of IPv6 support, firewall restrictions, and permission restrictions.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The initial solutions didn't resolve the issue for Andrea3i.\n* Further investigation is needed with the scheduling of a screen recording and running a utility for the error code.\n* The root cause is still being investigated with several potential problems identified.",
