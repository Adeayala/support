Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url. I tried navigating manually to the url opened by the launch button in Visual Studio [(url)](http://localhost:1000/?application=%7B%22name%22%3A%22VISUAL_STUDIO%22%2C%22platform%22%3A%22WINDOWS%22%2C%22privacy%22%3A%22OPEN%22%2C%22capabilities%22%3A%22BLENDED%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22MANUAL%22%2C%22schema%22%3A%7B%22semantic%22%3A%22MAJOR_0_MINOR_0_PATCH_1%22%2C%22migration%22%3A0%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%229ab3c1de-0625-408e-8d42-8e2c48e11d0c%22%2C%22version%22%3A%223.0.0%22%2C%22onboarded%22%3Afalse%2C%22automaticUnload%22%3Afalse%7D&capabilities=1048575&theme=%7B%22darkMode%22%3Atrue%2C%22scaffoldBackgroundColor%22%3A-14737633%2C%22primary%22%3A-328966%2C%22secondary%22%3A-14737633%2C%22onPrimary%22%3A-10724260%2C%22onSecondary%22%3A-328966%2C%22primaryContainer%22%3A-13421773%2C%22surface%22%3A-13750738%2C%22onSurface%22%3A-328966%2C%22error%22%3A-934979%2C%22onError%22%3A-1%7D) and the response is \"Route not found\".\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[log-11252024.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903747/log-11252024.txt)\n[applications.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903752/applications.txt)\n\n## Summary of the GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Problem:** User `Andrea3i` is experiencing issues with the OS toolbar not launching from Visual Studio, the desktop app, or manually. They also report unexpected restarts of Pieces OS and lack of response from the system tray icon.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Sentry issues #6082482383 and #6082482402 indicate problems with the toolbar launch.\n* User tried launching the toolbar from various methods, but none worked.\n* Initial investigation pointed to a UI thread hang in the Visual Studio plugin (version 3.0.0).\n* A hotfix release of the plugin (version 3.0.1) was attempted to address the issue.\n* A further issue with port selection for webview integrations was identified.\n* A second release (Pieces OS version 10.1.15) addressing the port issue was deployed.\n* Despite the releases, the user still experiences problems with the toolbar and unexpected restarts.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n* Hotfix release of the Visual Studio plugin (version 3.0.1).\n* Release of Pieces OS version 10.1.15 addressing port selection issues.\n* Further investigation and debugging session requested by the developer team.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n* The issue is ongoing and requires further investigation.\n* A debugging session is scheduled to gather more information and identify the root cause.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* This conversation highlights the ongoing effort from the development team to troubleshoot and resolve the user's issue.\n* The user is actively involved in the debugging process to help identify the root cause.\n* The outcome of the planned debugging session will determine the next steps towards resolving the issue.",
