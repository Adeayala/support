Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url.
