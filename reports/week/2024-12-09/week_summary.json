Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url. I tried navigating manually to the url opened by the launch button in Visual Studio [(url)](http://localhost:1000/?application=%7B%22name%22%3A%22VISUAL_STUDIO%22%2C%22platform%22%3A%22WINDOWS%22%2C%22privacy%22%3A%22OPEN%22%2C%22capabilities%22%3A%22BLENDED%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22MANUAL%22%2C%22schema%22%3A%7B%22semantic%22%3A%22MAJOR_0_MINOR_0_PATCH_1%22%2C%22migration%22%3A0%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%229ab3c1de-0625-408e-8d42-8e2c48e11d0c%22%2C%22version%22%3A%223.0.0%22%2C%22onboarded%22%3Afalse%2C%22automaticUnload%22%3Afalse%7D&capabilities=1048575&theme=%7B%22darkMode%22%3Atrue%2C%22scaffoldBackgroundColor%22%3A-14737633%2C%22primary%22%3A-328966%2C%22secondary%22%3A-14737633%2C%22onPrimary%22%3A-10724260%2C%22onSecondary%22%3A-328966%2C%22primaryContainer%22%3A-13421773%2C%22surface%22%3A-13750738%2C%22onSurface%22%3A-328966%2C%22error%22%3A-934979%2C%22onError%22%3A-1%7D) and the response is \"Route not found\".\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[log-11252024.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903747/log-11252024.txt)\n[applications.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903752/applications.txt)\n\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* @Andrea3i is experiencing issues with the OS toolbar not launching when clicked from Visual Studio, the desktop app, or directly.\n* The issue also includes Pieces OS restarting unexpectedly.\n* @robert-at-pieces initially suspects a problem with the Visual Studio plugin initialization but later discovers a broader OS error. \n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* The OS toolbar fails to launch in all scenarios.\n* Pieces OS restarts unexpectedly.\n* The exact reason for the OS error is unclear due to missing information.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* @robert-at-pieces proposes updates to the Visual Studio plugin and Pieces OS.\n* They suggest gathering a screen recording to further diagnose the issue.\n* @mark-at-pieces proposes debugging the issue with further assistance from @Andrea3i.\n* @robert-at-pieces suggests running a utility to obtain the OS error code for precise diagnosis.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The updated Visual Studio plugin and Pieces OS versions haven't resolved the issue.\n* The OS error code needs to be retrieved for further diagnosis.\n* A debugging session is scheduled to gather more information.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The provided logs may hold valuable information for troubleshooting.\n* The conversation suggests ongoing communication and collaboration to resolve the issue.",
