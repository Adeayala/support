Every time I click it, a \"Sentry Error Event\" appears in the log file and the application doesn't do anything.\nAt the same time, the Visual Studio extension shows a window saying that Pieces OS is not running. If I click on the launch button, a \"route not found\" message appears for a moment and then the \"Pieces OS is not running\" message comes back.\n\nI checked for updates on the Pieces Suite app, but there are no update.\n\nI'm attaching the log file and the response of the http://localhost:1000/applications url. I tried navigating manually to the url opened by the launch button in Visual Studio [(url)](http://localhost:1000/?application=%7B%22name%22%3A%22VISUAL_STUDIO%22%2C%22platform%22%3A%22WINDOWS%22%2C%22privacy%22%3A%22OPEN%22%2C%22capabilities%22%3A%22BLENDED%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22MANUAL%22%2C%22schema%22%3A%7B%22semantic%22%3A%22MAJOR_0_MINOR_0_PATCH_1%22%2C%22migration%22%3A0%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%229ab3c1de-0625-408e-8d42-8e2c48e11d0c%22%2C%22version%22%3A%223.0.0%22%2C%22onboarded%22%3Afalse%2C%22automaticUnload%22%3Afalse%7D&capabilities=1048575&theme=%7B%22darkMode%22%3Atrue%2C%22scaffoldBackgroundColor%22%3A-14737633%2C%22primary%22%3A-328966%2C%22secondary%22%3A-14737633%2C%22onPrimary%22%3A-10724260%2C%22onSecondary%22%3A-328966%2C%22primaryContainer%22%3A-13421773%2C%22surface%22%3A-13750738%2C%22onSurface%22%3A-328966%2C%22error%22%3A-934979%2C%22onError%22%3A-1%7D) and the response is \"Route not found\".\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[log-11252024.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903747/log-11252024.txt)\n[applications.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17903752/applications.txt)\n\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* OS toolbar not launching when trying to launch the Visual Studio plugin.\n* Toolbar not launching in any way (from VS, desktop app, etc.).\n* Pieces OS restarting on its own.\n* Applet issues persisting.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Visual Studio plugin version 3.0.0 issue with new webview based Tool Window.\n* Dart language sdk not returning the actual OS error code.\n* OS error trying to host applets.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Visual Studio plugin hotfix version 3.0.1 released to resolve UI thread hang.\n* Pieces OS version 10.1.15 released with changes to webview port selection.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The above solutions may not have fully resolved the issue.\n* Further debugging is needed to identify the root cause of the OS error.\n* A time is being scheduled with the user to gather more information and potentially run a utility to retrieve the OS error code.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user is experiencing issues with both the VS plugin and Pieces OS itself.\n* The problem seems to be related to an OS error, but the specific cause is still unknown.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nWhile some solutions have been implemented, the user is still experiencing issues.

Unfortunately, I have an unstable network connection (which is why I want a local model in the first place.) I am trying to get Mistral-7B.\n\nI found that Pieces wants to download the whole model (4 GB) all at once. If it fails for whatever reason, it restarts from the beginning.  This is annoying and it makes downloading virtually impossible, because my network connection does not stay long enough to pull 4GB in one go.\n\nI have figured out where the file is being downloaded to and from, and managed to download it manually with wget. Now the problem is that Pieces refuses to recognize it. Even if I put it in the right place, the Pieces app stil shows the Download button in the UI, and clicking Download truncates the file to zero and starts the download from the beginning.\n\nI tried to edit models.db and change \"downloaded\" to true in the relevant line, but it has no effect.\n\nIs there anything else I could do?\nNo comments found on this issue.",
