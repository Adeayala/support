## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS plugin conflicts and crashes
Multiple users report conflicts between Pieces OS plugins and other software. Kaspersky flags Pieces OS as a virus. The Visual Studio plugin blanks the Diagnostic Tools pane.  The native_extensions_plugin.dll causes crashes.  Reinstalling, disabling antivirus/firewall, and updating drivers haven't resolved the crashing issue.

### 2. Software Conflicts and Download Issues
Users report software conflicts (Kaspersky, VS Code, Pieces OS) and download issues with local LLMs.  Conflicts manifest as blank diagnostic panes or false virus flags. Download issues involve LLMs getting stuck on initializing, potentially due to network or compatibility problems.  Check for software updates and network connectivity.  Provide OS and software versions for further analysis.
