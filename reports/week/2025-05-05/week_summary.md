## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS conflicts causing crashes and interference
Multiple users report Pieces OS (v11.2.2.0 - 11.3.3) conflicts on Windows. Kaspersky flags it as a virus, and its VS extension blanks the Diagnostic tools pane in VS 2022 v17.14.0 Preview 4.0.  `native_extensions_plugin.dll` causes crashes.  Reinstalling, disabling antivirus/firewall, and driver updates don't resolve crashes.  Disabling the VS extension restores diagnostic output.  Further investigation into plugin compatibility and software conflicts is needed.

### 2. Pieces OS and VS Code Integration Issues
