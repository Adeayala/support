## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS: Conflicts and Crashes
Multiple users report conflicts between Pieces OS and other software (Kaspersky, Visual Studio). Symptoms include Kaspersky flagging Pieces OS as a virus, Visual Studio's diagnostic tools malfunctioning, and Pieces OS crashing due to native_extensions_plugin.dll.  Suggested solutions include disabling the Pieces plugin, reinstalling Pieces OS, and checking antivirus/firewall settings. Further investigation into native_extensions_plugin.dll is needed.

### 2. Software Conflicts and Download Issues
Users report software conflicts (Kaspersky, VS Code, Pieces OS) and download issues with local LLMs.  Conflicts manifest as blank diagnostic panes or false virus flags. Download issues involve LLMs getting stuck on initializing, potentially due to network issues or version incompatibility.  Check network connectivity, update Pieces OS and VS Code extensions, and whitelist Pieces in antivirus software.
