OS login failure points to a backend error during sign-in. Copilot problem manifests as infinite loading, despite conversation summaries updating.  Suggested solutions include verifying Asana integration setup, checking OS logs for login errors, and examining Copilot logs for Sentry errors or connectivity issues. Reinstallation and resets have been attempted by users with limited success.",

I've tried hard-resetting, restarting, reinstalling, On-Device LLMs, and Cloud LLMs. The weird thing is, some of the conversations will have a summary or will update the name of the conversation, but it never responds in the chat. I looked at the logs and saw repeated Sentry Event Errors, but not sure what to do with that.  I attached the log file from the day before yesterday (yesterday's is too large and won't upload). What should I do?\n\nThanks!\n\n[log-04292025.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19997109/log-04292025.txt)\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
