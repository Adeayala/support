I've tried hard-resetting, restarting, reinstalling, On-Device LLMs, and Cloud LLMs. The weird thing is, some of the conversations will have a summary or will update the name of the conversation, but it never responds in the chat. I looked at the logs and saw repeated Sentry Event Errors, but not sure what to do with that.  I attached the log file from the day before yesterday (yesterday's is too large and won't upload). What should I do?\n\nThanks!\n\n[log-04292025.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19997109/log-04292025.txt)\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
