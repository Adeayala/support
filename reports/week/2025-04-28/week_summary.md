## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS 11.3.3 Bugs on Linux and Windows
Pieces OS 11.3.3 exhibits distinct issues on Linux and Windows. On Linux, login attempts via PFD result in HTTP 500 errors, indicated by a persistent spinner and an error page.  Logs show a 500 error for /os/sign_in. On Windows, with the Pieces plugin enabled in Visual Studio 2022 (v17.14.0 Preview 4.0), the Diagnostic tools pane remains blank during debugging. Disabling the plugin restores functionality.
