## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Integrations and Core Features Malfunctioning
Users report issues with Asana handshake, Pieces OS login (HTTP 500 error), and Copilot unresponsiveness.  Asana issue involves webhook creation and header handling. OS login failure points to a backend error during sign-in. Copilot problem manifests as infinite loading, despite conversation summaries updating.  Suggested solutions include verifying Asana integration setup, checking OS logs for login errors, and examining Copilot logs for Sentry errors or connectivity issues. Reinstallation and resets have been attempted by users with limited success.

### 2. Copilot not responding or generating output
Users across different operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux) are reporting that Copilot is unresponsive, not generating any output, or continuously loading.
