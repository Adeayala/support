- Provide users with temporary workarounds, such as disabling the Pieces VS extension, while investigating the root cause of the issue.
- Improve communication with users regarding ongoing investigations and estimated resolution times for reported issues.
- Implement better error handling and logging to capture more detailed information about the issues encountered by users.
- Consider increasing testing coverage across different platforms and configurations to identify and address potential issues earlier in the development cycle.
- Develop a more robust process for tracking and prioritizing bug reports to ensure timely resolution of critical issues.
- Investigate the high frequency of issues related to Copilot, Pieces OS login, and the Visual Studio extension to identify underlying patterns or systemic problems.
