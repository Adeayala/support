with the initial boot-up of his database.\n* The issue persisted even after uninstalling and deleting the database folder.\n* The user was using an Intel CPU i7-2600 which doesn't support AVX2, causing problems with CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch extension.\n\n**Problem Identified:**\n\n* Initial boot-up database error due to corrupted or missing database files.\n* Lack of AVX2 support in the user's CPU causing compatibility issues.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark, a Pieces support representative, suggested the user delete the entire database folder.\n* Mark investigated the issue internally and proposed a potential fix with additional logging.\n* A new version (11.3.1) with the fix was released.\n* Antoine identified the core issue as the missing \"com.pieces.os\\production\\Pieces\\couchbase.cblite2\" folder and the lack of AVX2 support on his CPU.\n* Mark planned to release a new version (11.3.2) addressing these issues.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Version 11.3.2 was released, fixing the database error and addressing compatibility issues with older CPUs.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* This summary highlights the collaborative effort between the user and Pieces support in identifying and resolving the issue. \n* It demonstrates the value of detailed troubleshooting information provided by Antoine, enabling Mark to pinpoint the root cause.",
