## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS 11.3.0 Update Causes Issues
Users report two main issues after updating to Pieces OS 11.3.0: login failures and database corruption. Login attempts get stuck in an infinite loop on the authentication page. Database errors prevent the application from starting. Proposed solutions include using the 'Connect Account' button in the Pieces Toolbar for login and contacting support for database issues. The Pieces team is actively investigating both issues.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and resolve the authentication issue causing login failures after the Pieces OS 11.3.0 update.
- Investigate and resolve the database corruption issue preventing Pieces OS from starting after the 11.3.0 update.
- Provide clear instructions to users on how to resolve database corruption issues, including potential workarounds like database recovery or reinstallation.
- Consider implementing a more robust database backup and recovery system to mitigate the impact of database corruption issues.
- Improve communication with users regarding ongoing issues and their estimated resolution timeframes, particularly for critical issues like login failures and database corruption.
