| [#686](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/686) | Pieces OS doesn't start because it's unable to open database due to corruption: LateInitializationError: Field 'database' has not been initialized. | 9.25 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS launch failure due to database errors
Users are experiencing issues with Pieces OS failing to launch after updating to version 11.3.0. The issue stems from database corruption or errors during the initial database bootup. Proposed solutions include deleting the database, waiting for the next version with a fix (11.3.1), and engaging in real-time debugging with the Pieces support team.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize database stability:** Investigate and address the root cause of database errors during Pieces OS launch, particularly after updates. This may involve improving database integrity checks, optimizing database boot-up processes, and ensuring backward compatibility of database structures after updates.
- **Enhance authentication flow robustness:** Review and improve the authentication flow to prevent infinite loading issues, especially after updates. Implement robust error handling and user-friendly feedback mechanisms during the authentication process.
- **Proactive communication for known issues:** For known critical issues like the authentication bug, establish a proactive communication channel to inform users about the problem, expected resolution time, and potential workarounds. This could involve in-app notifications, status page updates, or social media announcements.
- **Analyze support logs for early detection:** Develop automated systems to monitor and analyze support logs for patterns and anomalies. This can help in identifying emerging issues, understanding their impact, and potentially resolving them before they become widespread.
- **Improve self-service resources:** Create or update documentation, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides related to database errors and authentication issues. Provide clear instructions on how to gather relevant logs and report issues effectively.
