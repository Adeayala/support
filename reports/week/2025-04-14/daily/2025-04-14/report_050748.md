## Common Issues
### 1. Infinite loading on authentication page after update
Users on Pieces OS 11.3.0 (Windows) experience infinite loading at https://authentication.pieces.services/ after the update, preventing login. This might be due to a new authentication flow.  Suggested workarounds include logging in via the Pieces toolbar. The Pieces team is investigating and encourages users to share screen recordings for debugging.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize the authentication bug:** The infinite loading issue on the authentication page is severely impacting users. Allocate resources to investigate and resolve this urgently.
- **Improve communication:** Keep users informed about the authentication issue, acknowledge the problem, and provide updates on the resolution progress. Consider a temporary banner or notification within the Pieces OS and desktop application.
- **Gather more data:** Request affected users to share screen recordings to help reproduce and debug the authentication issue effectively.
- **Review update procedures:** Investigate why the latest Pieces OS update led to the authentication issue. Review and enhance update testing procedures to prevent similar problems in future releases.
- **Enhance documentation:** Create or update documentation to guide users on alternative login methods, such as using the Pieces toolbar, while the authentication issue is being resolved.
