issue with their Pieces database upon initial bootup.\n* They were willing to delete the database entirely and needed assistance locating it.\n* The issue still persisted even after uninstalling the application and deleting the database folder.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* An issue with the initial bootup of the user's database prevented Pieces from functioning correctly.\n* The exact cause of the issue was not immediately apparent.\n* Even after deleting the database, the problem persisted, indicating a potential deeper issue.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The Pieces support team offered to debug the issue in real-time via a scheduled call.\n* They provided instructions on how to locate the database folder for manual deletion.\n* The team is internally investigating the issue and working on a potential fix.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is actively being investigated and addressed by the Pieces team.\n* A solution is not yet available, but the team is actively working on a fix.\n* The user is awaiting a resolution from the Pieces support team.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of readily available support resources for software issues.\n* The collaborative approach between the user and the support team demonstrates a proactive effort towards resolving the problem. \n* The lack of a current solution suggests the issue might be complex and require further investigation.",
