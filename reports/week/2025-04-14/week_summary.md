## Recommendations
- "Investigate and address the root cause of authentication issues after updates to prevent recurrence."
- "Prioritize thorough testing of database functionality during the development and release process to avoid corruption issues."
- "Explore options for removing or mitigating the dependency on AVX2 instruction sets to ensure compatibility with a wider range of hardware."
- "Improve communication to users about potential breaking changes and required hardware specifications in update release notes."
