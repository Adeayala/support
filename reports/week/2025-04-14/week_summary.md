## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Launch and Authentication Issues
Users reported issues with Pieces OS after updating to version 11.3.0, including infinite loading during login, invalid port errors, and database corruption preventing startup. Solutions involved workarounds like using WinGet for installation, deleting the database folder, and waiting for bug fix releases (11.3.2). Issues stemmed from installation problems, authentication flow glitches, and database corruption.

### 2. Pieces OS Database Corruption and Startup Crash
Users experience crashes or startup failures in Pieces OS versions 11.0.0 to 11.3.1 due to database corruption or missing AVX2 processor support.  This manifests as 'Unexpected error occurred' or 'LateInitializationError: Field 'database' has not been initialized'. Solutions include upgrading to version 11.3.2 or higher, reinstalling the application, or deleting the database folder.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize database stability:** The most frequent and active issues revolve around database corruption and startup failures. Focus development efforts on ensuring database integrity, improving error handling, and providing clear recovery steps for users.
- **Investigate installation issues on Windows:** Several tickets mention problems with installation, particularly on Windows, potentially related to admin privileges. Review the installation process, clarify documentation, and consider alternative installation methods like WinGet.
- **Address authentication flow glitches:** Authentication issues, especially after updates, are a recurring theme. Thoroughly test authentication flows across different platforms and versions to prevent regressions.
- **Improve communication on processor requirements:**  The lack of AVX2 support caused startup issues. Clearly communicate system requirements, including processor compatibility, to prevent users from encountering avoidable problems.
- **Proactively monitor error logs and user reports:**  Utilize error tracking tools and actively monitor user reports for patterns or spikes in specific issues to identify and address problems early on.
