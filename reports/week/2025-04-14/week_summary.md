## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Database Corruption on Startup
Users report Pieces OS failing to start due to database corruption on various operating systems. The issue stems from a missing subfolder crucial for database initialization and a dependency requiring AVX2 support, affecting older CPUs. Proposed solutions include manually creating the missing folder and a fix addressing both issues in a future release.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize database stability:** Investigate and address the root cause of the database corruption issue impacting Pieces OS startup. This appears to be a recurring problem affecting multiple users across different operating systems.
- **Improve communication on AVX2 dependency:** Clearly communicate the AVX2 support requirement for Pieces OS, potentially including it in the system requirements or release notes. This will help users with older CPUs understand compatibility issues.
- **Monitor authentication flow:** While the recent authentication issue seems resolved, continue monitoring the authentication process for any recurring problems, especially after updates.
- **Review and update documentation:** Ensure that the documentation and troubleshooting guides are updated to include information about the database corruption issue and its potential solutions, including the AVX2 dependency.
