## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving database corruption issues:** This is a recurring and high-impact problem affecting both macOS and Windows users. Investigate the root cause of the database corruption and implement a permanent fix. Consider adding more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- **Improve communication around system requirements:** The AVX2 support issue highlights the importance of clearly communicating system requirements to users. Ensure that minimum system requirements are prominently displayed on the download page, installation instructions, and release notes.
- **Develop a troubleshooting guide for common startup issues:** Create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for users experiencing startup problems, including database corruption, application crashes, and login issues. This guide should include step-by-step instructions, potential solutions, and links to relevant support resources.
- **Investigate the authentication process:** While the issue with https://authentication.pieces.services/ has been resolved, it's crucial to investigate the root cause and implement measures to prevent similar issues in the future. Review the authentication flow, error handling, and server-side logs for potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities.
- **Consider implementing a system health check:** Introduce a system health check feature within the application to proactively identify potential issues like database corruption or incompatible system configurations. This feature could alert users to potential problems and provide recommendations for resolution before they experience critical errors.
- **Continue monitoring user feedback:** Actively monitor support tickets, community forums, and social media for emerging trends or new issues. This will help you stay ahead of potential problems and address them proactively.
