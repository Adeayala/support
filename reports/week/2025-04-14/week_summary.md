## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS account linking and login issues across platforms
Users reported issues with account linking (primarily Google and GitHub) and login failures on Windows and Linux. Problems included infinite loading during authentication, single account linking limitations, and HTTP 500 errors. Solutions involved support team intervention, manual account linking, software updates, and log analysis. Some issues were resolved quickly, while others required ongoing investigation.

### 3. Pieces OS Crash/Startup Failure Due to Database Corruption
Multiple users reported Pieces OS crashing or failing to start on macOS and Windows due to database corruption errors.  A common error message was "LateInitializationError: Field 'database' has not been initialized." Issues were often resolved by updating to the latest version (e.g., 11.3.2), which included fixes for database corruption and missing subfolders.  One user resolved the issue by manually creating a missing subfolder. In some cases, CPU incompatibility with the AVX2 instruction set caused issues.
