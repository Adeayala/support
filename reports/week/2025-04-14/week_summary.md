| [#686](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/686) | Pieces OS doesn't start because it's unable to open database due to corruption: LateInitializationError: Field 'database' has not been initialized. | 9.25 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS startup and authentication issues
Users reported Pieces OS failing to start due to database corruption, resulting in a "LateInitializationError". This was addressed by identifying the database location for manual deletion and releasing a new version with additional logging. Separately, an authentication issue caused infinite loading when linking Google accounts after updating to version 11.3.0. This was resolved by a hotfix deployed by the Pieces team.

## Recommendations
- **Proactively address database issues:** Develop a more robust database recovery or repair mechanism to prevent corruption and ensure smooth startup for users.
- **Improve authentication flow testing:** Implement rigorous testing for authentication flows, especially after significant updates, to catch issues like the infinite loading problem early on.
- **Enhance communication on known issues:**  During updates that force user logout, provide clear and prominent communication about the expected behavior to reduce user confusion and support tickets.
- **Consider a dedicated status page:** For transparency and to reduce support load, consider implementing a status page that provides real-time information about service availability and known issues.
- **Gather more detailed logs:** Implement more detailed logging around startup and authentication processes to aid in faster troubleshooting and issue identification in the future.
