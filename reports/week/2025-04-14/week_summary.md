## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving account linking and authentication issues as they are persistent and affect user experience.
- Investigate and address the root cause of database corruption leading to OS/Desktop app crashes and startup failures.
- Improve the installation process on Windows to prevent "Invalid Port" errors and ensure proper initialization.
- Develop a more robust login process, especially for Linux users experiencing HTTP 500 errors.
- Provide clear documentation or troubleshooting steps for users experiencing account linking and login issues.
- Consider removing the AVX2 dependency or providing alternative solutions for users with older CPUs.
- Proactively monitor and address issues related to new plugin integration to prevent application crashes.
- Analyze support logs and user feedback to identify and fix recurring issues promptly.
- Improve communication with users by providing timely updates and acknowledging reported issues.
- Offer alternative support channels like live chat or email for non-critical issues to reduce call volume.
