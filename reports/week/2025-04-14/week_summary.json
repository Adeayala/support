Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Account Linking\n\n### Key Points Raised:\n\n* Johnkennyuk is having issues linking his personal domain email account to his GitHub account.\n* The current account linking flow is not working properly.\n* A new auth service is being developed and will be released in early/mid March.\n* Johnkennyuk linked his accounts in the wrong order using the new auth app.\n\n### Problems Identified:\n\n* The current account linking flow is not user-friendly and has bugs.\n* Johnkennyuk's personal domain email and GitHub email have a capitalization difference in the first character, which may be causing the linking issue.\n* Johnkennyuk linked his accounts in the wrong order using the new auth app.\n\n### Solutions Proposed/Implemented:\n\n* Mark-at-pieces offered to manually merge the accounts.\n* Mark-at-pieces suggested waiting for the new auth service to be released.\n* Mark-at-pieces reset Johnkennyuk's GitHub account multiple times.\n* Johnkennyuk successfully linked his accounts using the new auth app but in the wrong order.\n* Mark-at-pieces offered to help Johnkennyuk relink his accounts.\n\n### Current Status/Outcome:\n\n* Johnkennyuk's accounts are currently linked in the wrong order.\n* Mark-at-pieces will help Johnkennyuk relink his accounts.\n* The new auth service is expected to be released in early/mid March.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n* The new auth service will allow Johnkennyuk to link his personal domain email account to his GitHub account.\n* Mark-at-pieces offered to schedule a meeting with Johnkennyuk to resolve the issue.\n* Johnkennyuk expressed interest in being one of the first users to try out the new auth service.",
