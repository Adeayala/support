Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of Github Issue Conversation: Account Linking Issues for @johnkennyuk\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* @johnkennyuk experienced problems linking his personal domain (connected to Google account) with his Github account. \n* Existing account linking flow was subpar and a new system was planned for mid-late February 2025.\n* @johnkennyuk preferred to keep his personal domain as the primary account. \n* Email capitalization discrepancies were suspected as a potential cause.\n* @johnkennyuk confirmed the issue persisted even after troubleshooting steps.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow was difficult and prone to errors.\n* Capitalized character in the registered email addresses might have caused linking issues.\n* New system rollout was delayed and not yet ready for deployment.\n* @johnkennyuk accidentally linked accounts in the wrong order with the new system.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Manual account merging offered by Pieces support.\n* Screen recording requested from @johnkennyuk for further troubleshooting.\n* Email address inconsistency resolved on Pieces side.\n* Reset of @johnkennyuk's Github account for re-linking.\n* New authentication system development and deployment scheduled for early/mid March 2025.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* New authentication system is now available (April 2025).\n* @johnkennyuk successfully linked his accounts using the new system but accidentally did it in the wrong order.\n* @johnkennyuk is waiting for assistance to reset the account link and try again.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* New system rollout experienced some delays.\n* Capitalization in email addresses might have contributed to initial linking issues.\n* @johnkennyuk was helpful in providing information and feedback throughout the process.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* @johnkennyuk will schedule a call to resolve the account linking order issue with Pieces support.",
