  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize database corruption issue:** Allocate resources to urgently investigate and resolve the root cause of the database corruption issue impacting Pieces OS startup on Windows and macOS. This issue has the highest frequency and is causing significant user frustration.",
    "**Improve authentication flow:** While the authentication issue (ticket #685) is resolved, its high activity level suggests potential for improvement. Review the authentication flow, identify any friction points, and simplify the process for a smoother user experience.",
    "**Enhance error messaging:** Provide more user-friendly error messages for database corruption issues. Instead of technical jargon, guide users towards potential solutions like reinstalling the app or contacting support.",
    "**Develop proactive measures:** Explore implementing database integrity checks or backups to prevent corruption and minimize data loss for users.",
    "**Improve issue duplication handling:** While ticket #688 was marked as a duplicate, its activity level suggests potential for improvement. Ensure users are automatically directed to the primary issue and provided with clear updates and solutions from the primary ticket.",
    "**Gather more diagnostic information:** Request detailed logs and system information from users experiencing the database corruption issue to aid in diagnosis and resolution.",
    "**Consider platform-specific troubleshooting:** Given the issue appears on both Windows and macOS, develop platform-specific troubleshooting guides for users and support agents.",
    "**Proactively communicate known issues:** Maintain a publicly accessible list of known issues and workarounds to keep users informed and reduce support ticket volume."
