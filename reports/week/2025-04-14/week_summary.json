Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of the GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n* User (@johnkennyuk) is experiencing issues linking their Google and Github accounts.\n* This was due to the email addresses being registered with different capitalizations.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n* Account linking process is not user-friendly.\n* Email capitalization discrepancy caused merging issues.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n* Manual account merging assistance offered by support team (@mark-at-pieces).\n* Resetting user accounts to attempt linking again.\n* New authentication system with unified account linking is under development.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n* User's issue temporarily resolved through manual merging.\n* Waiting for the new authentication system to be fully implemented for permanent solution.\n* New system expected to be released in early/mid March.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* User will be informed when the new system is ready for use.\n* Manual account resetting will be provided before attempting relinking.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize database and authentication issues:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around Pieces OS login, account linking, and database errors. Allocating more resources to investigate and resolve these root causes will significantly impact overall support volume.",
    "**Investigate platform-specific problems:** Several issues are reported specifically on Windows and Linux. Focused testing and debugging on these platforms can help identify and address platform-specific bugs.",
    "**Improve documentation for account linking and installation:** Issues related to account linking and installation (like the invalid port error) suggest a need for clearer documentation. Providing step-by-step guides and troubleshooting tips can empower users to resolve these issues independently.",
    "**Proactively address CPU compatibility:** The AVX2 CPU incompatibility issue caused significant problems. Implementing a system to detect incompatible hardware and offer alternative solutions or guidance can prevent similar issues in the future.",
    "**Monitor and analyze support trends:** Regularly analyze support data to identify recurring issues, emerging trends, and areas for improvement. This will enable proactive problem-solving and resource allocation for optimal support operations."
