          "text": "Pieces Desktop app, account linking never acheived for several years?\n### Software\n\nDesktop Application\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nWindows\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\n11.0.4\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [x] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\nI have been experiencing an issue with the Pieces Desktop app where I am unable to link both my Google and GitHub accounts simultaneously. Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk was experiencing issues linking his Github and Google accounts.\n* Mark-at-pieces, a support representative, identified the problem as two separate accounts registered with different email capitalization.\n* A workaround was attempted by merging the accounts, but the capitalization issue persisted.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Mark-at-pieces suggested waiting for a new authentication system to be implemented (estimated timeframe: early/mid March).\n* Johnkennyuk successfully linked his accounts using the new authentication system but in the wrong order.\n* Mark-at-pieces offered to schedule a call to resolve the issue.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue is temporarily resolved with the new authentication system.\n* Johnkennyuk needs to re-link his accounts in the correct order.\n* Mark-at-pieces is available to assist with this process.\n\n**Additional points:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk is a senior IT engineer and confident in resolving the issue himself.\n* Mark-at-pieces acknowledged the capitalization issue as a known problem with the old authentication system.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe issue is resolved with the new authentication system, but a minor correction is needed. Mark-at-pieces is available to assist with this final step.",
