  "recommendations": [
    "**Proactively address database issues:** Develop a more robust database recovery or repair mechanism to prevent corruption and ensure smooth startup for users.",
    "**Improve authentication flow testing:** Implement rigorous testing for authentication flows, especially after significant updates, to catch issues like the infinite loading problem early on.",
    "**Enhance communication on known issues:**  During updates that force user logout, provide clear and prominent communication about the expected behavior to reduce user confusion and support tickets.",
    "**Consider a dedicated status page:** For transparency and to reduce support load, consider implementing a status page that provides real-time information about service availability and known issues.",
    "**Gather more detailed logs:** Implement more detailed logging around startup and authentication processes to aid in faster troubleshooting and issue identification in the future."
