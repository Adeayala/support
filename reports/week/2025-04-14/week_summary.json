Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User johnkennyuk is having trouble linking their Github and Google accounts in Pieces.\n* The current account linking flow is not working properly and is being replaced.\n* User's email addresses have a capitalization difference, which may be causing the issue.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Account linking flow is not working.\n* User's email addresses have a capitalization difference.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark, a Pieces support member, offered to manually merge the accounts.\n* User's Github account was reset multiple times.\n* User was advised to wait for the new account linking system.\n* New account linking system is now available and user was able to link their accounts successfully.\n* User accidentally linked accounts in the wrong order and needs them reset.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User's accounts are linked in the wrong order.\n* Mark offered to schedule a time to help the user resolve the issue.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new account linking system is still in development and may have some bugs.\n* It is not possible to reset account data server-side or client-side.",

I am not sure. But I have restarted and reinstalled to no effect.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Problem:**\n\n* Users are encountering an \"Invalid Port\" error when launching Pieces Desktop.\n* The root cause is likely the Pieces Desktop installer not requesting admin rights, leading to issues binding to a local port.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* This issue has been triaged and routed to the appropriate team member.\n* Affected users are seeing the error \"Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect.\"\n* Multiple users are facing this problem.\n* The problem seems to be specific to Windows users.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Install both PiecesOS and Pieces Desktop app using WinGet in an elevated PowerShell session.\n* This grants the installer admin rights, allowing it to configure the local server correctly.\n* The Pieces team is working on adjusting installation methods to reflect this requirement.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The workaround provided by a user (zedevmed) has been confirmed as effective.\n* The Pieces team is actively working on a permanent solution and updating documentation to reflect the recommended installation method.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The Pieces team is requesting affected users to provide additional information and participate in troubleshooting calls.\n* The issue seems to be specific to Windows installations and potentially specific to certain Windows versions or configurations.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n* Affected users can try the workaround mentioned above.\n* Participate in troubleshooting calls with the Pieces team if requested.\n* Keep an eye on the GitHub issue for updates on a permanent solution.",
