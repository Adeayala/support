Where the desktop app is being initialized. I am at verify dependency connections and it says unable to open pieces core services. \"FormatException: Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect.\n\nIt might be an antivirus stopping it. I am not sure. But I have restarted and reinstalled to no effect.\n## Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* SherlockSol reported an issue with Pieces Desktop not launching on their Windows PC.\n* The issue was related to an invalid port error: `Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect`.\n* The issue was difficult to reproduce and diagnose.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The Pieces Desktop app was unable to bind to a local port properly.\n* This was likely caused by the app not requesting administrator privileges during installation.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Pieces team requested additional information (logs, hardware details, etc.) from SherlockSol.\n* A video call was scheduled to troubleshoot the issue live.\n* Uzaxirr reported experiencing the same issue.\n* Zedevmed suggested installing both PiecesOS and Pieces Desktop app using WinGet in an elevated PowerShell session as a potential solution.\n* Tsavo-at-pieces confirmed this solution and requested to update the documentation to reflect the correct installation method.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue seems to be resolved by installing the apps using WinGet in an elevated PowerShell session.\n* Pieces team is working on updating the documentation to reflect this solution.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation indicates that the issue may have been caused by the .exe installer not requesting admin rights during installation.\n* This issue affected users on Windows 10 (Enterprise).",
