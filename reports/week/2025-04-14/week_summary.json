Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (johnkennyuk) experiencing issues with account linking.\n* Current account linking flow is outdated and not straightforward.\n* User prefers to keep their personal domain linked to their Google account.\n* Issue may be caused by a capitalization issue in the email address.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Two separate accounts were created due to a bug in earlier versions of the application.\n* User's personal domain is not linked to their Google account.\n* New auth service is not yet released.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark-at-pieces offered to merge the two accounts and guide the user through the account linking flow.\n* User tried to resolve the issue themselves but encountered further problems.\n* Mark-at-pieces reset the user's GitHub account and suggested waiting for the new auth service to be released.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The new auth service is still under development and expected to be released in early/mid March 2025.\n* User successfully linked their accounts using the new auth app but in the wrong order.\n* User requested a reset to relink their accounts in the correct order.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of proper account linking and the need for a more user-friendly flow.\n* It also demonstrates the challenges that can arise due to bugs in earlier versions of an application.\n* The user's patience and willingness to wait for the new auth service is appreciated.",

Users are able to link their Google accounts and login to Pieces successfully.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* Users were asked to provide support logs for troubleshooting.\n* The issue appears to be specific to Windows 11.\n\n**I hope this summary is helpful.

bootup issue.\n* User attempts to fix the issue by deleting the database folder but encounters the same problem with the latest version (11.3.1). \n* User reports the issue after the latest update and provides detailed information about their operating system, application version, and logs.\n* Another user (NidroySoft) provides similar information and encounters the same error.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Initial bootup issue with the database.\n* Incomplete installation process not creating the necessary subfolder.\n* Hardware limitations (lack of AVX2 support) causing incompatibility with CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch extension.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Potential fix identified by Pieces Support team with additional logging in version 11.3.1.\n* User manually creates the missing subfolder.\n* Pieces Support team acknowledges the core issue and pushes a fix in version 11.3.2.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Issue resolved with the release of version 11.3.2.\n* Pieces Support team thanks the users for their patience and feedback.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The issue was caused by a combination of incomplete installation and hardware limitations.\n* The fix involved accounting for these cases and making the necessary adjustments.\n* The issue highlights the importance of clear and detailed communication between users and support teams.",

bootup issue.\n* User attempts to fix the issue by deleting the database folder but encounters the same problem with the latest version (11.3.1). \n* User reports the issue after the latest update and provides detailed information about their operating system, application version, and logs.\n* Another user (NidroySoft) provides similar information and encounters the same error.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Initial bootup issue with the database.\n* Incomplete installation process not creating the necessary subfolder.\n* Hardware limitations (lack of AVX2 support) causing incompatibility with CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch extension.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Potential fix identified by Pieces Support team with additional logging in version 11.3.1.\n* User manually creates the missing subfolder.\n* Pieces Support team acknowledges the core issue and pushes a fix in version 11.3.2.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Issue resolved with the release of version 11.3.2.\n* Pieces Support team thanks the users for their patience and feedback.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The issue was caused by a combination of incomplete installation and hardware limitations.\n* The fix involved accounting for these cases and making the necessary adjustments.\n* The issue highlights the importance of clear and detailed communication between users and support teams.",
