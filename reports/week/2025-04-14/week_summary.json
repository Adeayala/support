Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* The current account linking process is not user-friendly and needs improvement.\n* The user, johnkennyuk, has two accounts (GitHub and Google) and wants to merge them with their personal domain set on the Google account as the main one.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking process is not straightforward and requires a manual intervention.\n* There was a capitalization issue with the email address, preventing the accounts from merging.\n* The user accidentally linked their accounts in the wrong order with the new auth system.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The support team offered to manually merge the accounts.\n* The support team reset the user's GitHub account multiple times.\n* The user was advised to temporarily disable email privacy setting on their GitHub account.\n* The user was advised to wait for the new authentication system to be implemented.\n* The new authentication system was implemented and the user was able to successfully link their accounts.\n* The user accidentally linked their accounts in the wrong order and needs them reset again.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The user has successfully linked their accounts with the new authentication system, but in the wrong order.\n* The user is waiting for the support team to reset their accounts so they can link them again in the correct order.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new authentication system is still under development and is expected to be released in early/mid March.\n* The support team will reach out to the user when the new system is ready for use.",
