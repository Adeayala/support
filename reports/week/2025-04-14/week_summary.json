Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User johnkennyuk is experiencing issues linking their GitHub and Google accounts.\n* The current account linking flow is not user-friendly and is being replaced in mid-February.\n* The user's accounts were originally registered separately due to a bug in the application.\n* The user wants to keep their Google account as the main account and link their GitHub account to it.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not straightforward.\n* The user's accounts were registered separately causing linking issues.\n* There is a capitalization issue between the user's Google and GitHub email addresses.\n* The user accidentally linked their accounts in the wrong order using the new auth app.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark from Pieces offered to meet with the user to manually link their accounts.\n* Mark identified and adjusted the capitalization issue in the user's emails.\n* Mark reset the user's GitHub account to allow relinking.\n* The new auth app was released, replacing the old and less user-friendly linking flow.\n* Mark offered to help the user relink their accounts after they accidentally linked them in the wrong order.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The user is waiting for the new auth app to be fully implemented.\n* The user's accounts were temporarily relinked by Mark.\n* The user accidentally relinked their accounts in the wrong order using the new auth app.\n* Mark offered to help the user relink their accounts again.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new auth app is still under development and is expected to be released in early/mid-March.\n* The user's issues are likely related to the bug in the earlier versions of the application.\n* The new auth app will address the account linking issues and allow for more flexibility in linking different types of accounts.",
