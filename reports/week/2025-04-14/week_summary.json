extension used by Pieces OS.\n* Mark-at-pieces identified the core issue and developed a fix.\n* The fix was released in version 11.3.2 of Pieces OS.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Initial bootup issue with the database.\n* Missing subfolder in the installation directory.\n* Lack of AVX2 support on user's CPU, causing incompatibility with the CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch extension.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Real-time debugging by support representative.\n* Manual creation of the missing subfolder by the user.\n* Development of a fix by Pieces OS team to address the AVX2 support issue.\n* Release of the fix in version 11.3.2 of Pieces OS.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue has been resolved.\n* The fix is available in version 11.3.2 of Pieces OS.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue was difficult to reproduce due to the specific hardware configuration of the user's system.\n* The fix addresses both the database corruption issue and the

Where the desktop app is being initialized. I am at verify dependency connections and it says unable to open pieces core services. \"FormatException: Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect.\n\nIt might be an antivirus stopping it. I am not sure. But I have restarted and reinstalled to no effect.\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* SherlockSol reported an issue with an invalid port in Pieces Desktop.\n* Similar issues had been reported previously.\n* uzaxirr confirmed experiencing the same problem.\n* zedevmed identified the issue as stemming from the lack of admin rights during installation.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Pieces Desktop was not launching due to an invalid port error.\n* The .exe installer did not request admin rights, preventing proper port binding.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Nathan asked SherlockSol to share logs and hardware information.\n* Mack suggested a video call for live troubleshooting.\n* zedevmed proposed installing PiecesOS and Pieces Desktop using WinGet in an elevated PowerShell session.\n* Tsavo acknowledged the solution and suggested promoting the MSIX or winget installation method in the documentation.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue appears to be resolved by installing Pieces with admin privileges using WinGet.\n* The team is working on updating the documentation to promote the recommended installation methods.",

bootup issues with their database.\n* Support representative, mark-at-pieces, attempted to debug the issue in real-time but the problem persisted.\n* Further investigation revealed a corruption in the database due to a missing subfolder.\n* Antoine79 manually created the missing folder and discovered the core issue: their CPU lacked AVX2 support, which is required for the CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch extension used by Pieces OS.\n* Mark-at-pieces identified the core issue and developed a fix.\n* The fix was released in version 11.3.2 of Pieces OS.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Initial bootup issue with the database.\n* Missing subfolder in the installation directory.\n* Lack of AVX2 support on user's CPU, causing incompatibility with the CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch extension.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Real-time debugging by support representative.\n* Manual creation of the missing subfolder by the user.\n* Development of a fix by Pieces OS team to address the AVX2 support issue.\n* Release of the fix in version 11.3.2 of Pieces OS.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue has been resolved.\n* The fix is available in version 11.3.2 of Pieces OS.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue was difficult to reproduce due to the specific hardware configuration of the user's system.\n* The fix addresses both the database corruption issue and the AVX2 support issue.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolution of database corruption issues:** This recurring problem causes startup failures and app crashes, significantly impacting user experience. Investigate the root causes, potentially related to plugin integration, missing folders, or CPU compatibility, and implement robust solutions.",
    "**Improve installation process and documentation:** Issues stemming from insufficient installation privileges and missing folders suggest a need for a more streamlined installation process. Update documentation to emphasize using WinGet with admin rights and clarify folder requirements.",
    "**Address Pieces OS update challenges:** The issues arising from the 11.3.0 update highlight the importance of thorough testing and communication. Implement stricter pre-release testing to catch bugs early and provide clear instructions to users on potential issues and workarounds during updates.",
    "**Consider a dedicated troubleshooting guide for database errors:** Given the frequency of database-related issues, create a dedicated section in the support documentation for troubleshooting these errors. Include common error messages, potential causes, and step-by-step solutions.",
    "**Monitor CPU compatibility and provide clear system requirements:** The issue with AVX2 support demonstrates the importance of considering hardware compatibility. Clearly communicate system requirements, including CPU specifications, and explore solutions for users with unsupported hardware configurations.",
    "**Proactively address authentication issues:** The significant activity around authentication problems indicates a need for continuous monitoring and rapid response. Implement proactive measures to detect and address authentication issues promptly, minimizing user disruption.",
    "**Analyze support ticket trends for proactive issue prevention:** Regularly analyze support ticket data to identify recurring problems and trends. This proactive approach allows for addressing root causes, improving product stability, and reducing future support requests.",
    "**Develop a system for early identification and merging of duplicate tickets:** Implement a system that can automatically detect and flag potentially duplicate tickets. This will help streamline support operations and prevent redundant efforts by merging similar issues and centralizing communication."
