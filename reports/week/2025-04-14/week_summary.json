But when I try to log in, always end up at https://authentication.pieces.services/ without moving forward. that page keep loading and nothing happens.\n## Summary of the GitHub issue conversation:\n\n**Problem:** Users are experiencing infinite loading when trying to link their Google accounts after updating Pieces OS to version 11.3.0 on Windows 11. This occurs when accessing https://authentication.pieces.services/ to log in.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The issue seems to be related to the new authentication flow implemented last week.\n* Manually refreshing the page during the authentication process may cause further issues.\n* It is recommended to use the \"Connect Account\" button in the Pieces Toolbar or any of their products to initiate the login process.\n* Users are encouraged to share screen recordings and support logs for troubleshooting.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n* The Pieces team is investigating the issue and working on a fix.\n* Users are advised to try logging in again through the recommended methods.\n* Support logs can be shared with the team for further analysis.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The issue has been identified and resolved by the Pieces team.\n* Users should be able to link their Google accounts successfully.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The issue is specific to Windows 11 users.\n* The pieces-support-bot automatically routed the issue to the relevant team member.\n* The team provided troubleshooting steps and offered to schedule support calls.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe authentication issue has been fixed and users should now be able to link their Google accounts after updating Pieces OS to version 11.3.0.",
