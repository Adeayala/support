  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize database stability:** Investigate and address the root cause of the database corruption issue impacting Pieces OS startup. This appears to be a recurring problem affecting multiple users across different operating systems.",
    "**Improve communication on AVX2 dependency:** Clearly communicate the AVX2 support requirement for Pieces OS, potentially including it in the system requirements or release notes. This will help users with older CPUs understand compatibility issues.",
    "**Monitor authentication flow:** While the recent authentication issue seems resolved, continue monitoring the authentication process for any recurring problems, especially after updates.",
    "**Review and update documentation:** Ensure that the documentation and troubleshooting guides are updated to include information about the database corruption issue and its potential solutions, including the AVX2 dependency."
