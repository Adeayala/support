Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of Conversation:\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* John created an issue about his inability to link his Pieces accounts.\n* Existing related issues were suggested, and helpful resources were provided.\n* The current account linking flow was acknowledged as inadequate, with a replacement planned for mid-to-late February.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* John's two accounts were not linked properly.\n* Account linking flow was not straightforward.\n* An email capitalization discrepancy might be causing issues.\n* The authentication service was outdated and caused inconsistencies.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Merging accounts was proposed.\n* Identifying the accounts to be merged.\n* Resetting John's GitHub account.\n* Temporarily disabling email privacy settings on GitHub.\n* Transitioning to a new authentication service by the end of the month.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The new authentication system is not yet ready.\n* John successfully linked his accounts after its release but in the wrong order.\n* Resetting the account link is pending.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The issue was acknowledged, and troubleshooting steps were taken.\n* John's patience and willingness to wait for the new system were appreciated.\n* A further conversation is scheduled to resolve the remaining issue.",
