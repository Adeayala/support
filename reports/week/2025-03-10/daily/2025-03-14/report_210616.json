(**Pending**)\n- Extension patch update to address the issue (**released in March 2025 as version 4.0.4**).\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n- The problem appears to have been resolved with the latest web extension update (version 4.0.4), which should prevent further flooding of the dev console with error messages.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- Potential Chrome bug might be contributing to the issue, but there's no clear fix at present.\n- Users can temporarily hide network messages in the dev console to reduce clutter.",

This suggests the issue might not be fully resolved for everyone.\n* **Call for troubleshooting:** Users experiencing lag were encouraged to schedule a chat with the development team for further investigation.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The issue persisted even after hard resets were performed by users.\n* The problem appeared to affect various operating systems, including Windows 11.",

          "text": "Pieces desktop application is very slow/laggy, not generating any response in copilot chat.\n### Software\n\nDesktop Application\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nWindows\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\n10.0.1\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [ ] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\nPieces desktop application is working very much slow after latest update, takes very much time to give any response. Even after doing a hard reset active runtime, it just do not work. \n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key point:** Copilot responsiveness was significantly slower than expected.\n\n**Problem:** A bug in the copilot's \"Hard-Reset Active Runtime\" function prevented proper re-initialization of a websocket. This caused the copilot to hang indefinitely while trying to load.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n* **Fix implemented:** The bug was fixed and released in a patch update (Pieces OS 10.0.2 & Pieces Desktop 3.0.2).\n* **Further performance improvements:** A subsequent update to the Desktop app (version 3.1.0) included further performance enhancements.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* **Mixed feedback:** While some users reported improved performance after the updates, others (e.g., JerryBenChizzy, navdeepdev459) continued to experience lag. This suggests the issue might not be fully resolved for everyone.\n* **Call for troubleshooting:** Users experiencing lag were encouraged to schedule a chat with the development team for further investigation.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The issue persisted even after hard resets were performed by users.\n* The problem appeared to affect various operating systems, including Windows 11.",
