My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation about Ollama Errors\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User johnkennyuk was experiencing Cuda errors with Ollama on Pieces OS.\n* The issue seemed to be related to a conflict between the Ollama installations on Pieces OS and the user's own installation.\n* The user tried various solutions, including uninstalling and reinstalling both Ollama and Pieces OS, but the problem persisted intermittently.\n* It was suspected that a race condition between the two Ollama instances was causing the issue.\n* Pieces OS was updated to version 11.1.2 to address the race condition.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Conflicting Ollama installations.\n* Race condition between Pieces OS and user's Ollama instance.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Uninstalling and reinstalling Ollama and Pieces OS.\n* Checking and cleaning up PATH environment variables.\n* Updating Pieces OS to version 11.1.2.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue appears to be resolved after the Pieces OS update.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user reported experiencing the issue again after updating to 11.1.2, but it seems to have been resolved since then.\n* The user prefers to use Winget for installations, updates, and uninstalls.",
