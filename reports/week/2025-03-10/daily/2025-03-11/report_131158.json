    "**Investigate and resolve Pieces Desktop and Extension functionality issues:** This appears to be the most common problem reported by users. Prioritize resolving the bug causing embed buttons to malfunction and error messages to appear.",
    "**Improve error messaging:** The \"this message is empty please try again\" error message is unclear and unhelpful. Provide more specific error messages that help users understand and troubleshoot the problem.",

    "**Consider creating a dedicated support channel for bug reports:** This would help to centralize bug reports and make it easier for the Pieces team to track and respond to them.",
    "**Proactively communicate known issues and workarounds to users:** This could be done through a dedicated page on the Pieces website, blog posts, or social media updates. Keeping users informed will help to reduce frustration and improve their experience.",
    "**Monitor support channels for emerging trends:** This will help you to identify and address new issues quickly. "
