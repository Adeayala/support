User cannot change their personal domain after copying folder to another PC.\n2. User wants to back up with their existing personal domain, but the available backup is outdated.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n1. **Personal domain:** pieces-support-bot suggested checking existing issues and documentation. mark-at-pieces asked laborer123 to try registering a new domain to confirm functionality.\n2. **Backup/restore:** mark-at-pieces explained that restoring would overwrite local data with the cloud backup. They provided a screenshot of the restore button and offered further assistance if needed.\n3. **Outdated backup:** mark-at-pieces suggested creating a new personal domain and backing up with that instead of using the outdated one.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* It is unclear whether laborer123 was able to successfully register a new domain or restore their data.\n* The issue remains open, indicating the user might require further assistance.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The user experienced difficulty backing up their current computer with their existing personal domain due to the old backup.\n* mark-at-pieces proposed creating a new personal domain for backup and restore.\n\nThis summary highlights the key points of the conversation and identifies the current status of the issue.
