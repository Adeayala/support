This involved addressing a potential Chrome bug.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue has been resolved. Users are advised to download the latest web extension version (4.0.4) to prevent the network request flooding.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* Users can also manually disable network logs in the developer console settings, although this might not be ideal for everyone.",
