My workaround is that I must quit Pieces OS completely then start Ollama server from its own shortcut then start Pieces OS??\n\nAny Ideas??\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Ollama server installation issues with Pieces OS\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User @johnkennyuk experiencing issues with Ollama server installation on Pieces OS.\n* Cuda errors related to cublas64_12.dll were encountered.\n* Multiple uninstall and reinstall attempts were made, including via winget and OllamaSetup.exe.\n* Potential conflict between Pieces OS and Ollama server startup order was suspected.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Broken Ollama installation due to winget installation error.\n* Conflicting Ollama server instances running simultaneously.\n* Race condition between Pieces OS and Ollama server startup causing errors.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Uninstalling Ollama via winget and reinstalling with OllamaSetup.exe.\n* Investigating potential incomplete installations and corrupted files.\n* Modifying startup order by delaying Pieces OS launch on sign-in.\n* Implementing changes in Pieces OS version 11.1.2 to address potential race condition.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Issue appears to be resolved after updating to Pieces OS version 11.1.2.\n* User will continue monitoring and report any further issues.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* User acknowledged the helpfulness of the developer's responses and collaboration in troubleshooting the issue.\n* The developer expressed willingness to provide further assistance if needed.",

In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Author:** pieces-support-bot (bot)\n\n**Date:** 2025-03-14\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* New issue submitted by user @bpluly.\n* Issue automatically triaged and routed to the appropriate Pieces team member.\n* User might find related issues helpful (links provided).\n* User encouraged to explore additional resources for support.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Issue content not disclosed.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Issue triaged and routed for investigation.\n* Recommendations for related issues and resources provided.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User waiting for follow-up from Pieces team member.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The summary focuses on the most important details provided in the conversation, highlighting the key points raised, problems identified, and actions taken. \n* The specific nature of the user's issue remains unknown. \n* The outcome of the ticket is currently pending.",
