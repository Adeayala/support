This is caused by a bug related to vector support.\n* The bug can also prevent users from seeing updates from the Long Term Memory (LTM) engine and accessing the \"Workstream Activity\" view.\n* Rebooting PiecesOS temporarily resolves the issue, but users will need to restart until the bug is fixed in the next version.\n* The issue is only related to vector support, which is not available on certain devices (e.g., M3 Macs).\n* There is an \"Unknown Origin\" element in the Pieces telemetry browser with version 1.0.10. This will be investigated further.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Bug in PiecesOS related to vector support causes devices to incorrectly run in \"basic mode\".\n* Users in \"basic mode\" cannot see updates from the LTM engine or access the \"Workstream Activity\" view.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Restarting PiecesOS temporarily resolves the issue.\n* A fix will be implemented in the next version of PiecesOS.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The bug is still present in the current version of PiecesOS.\n* Users experiencing the issue should restart PiecesOS until the fix is released.\n* The \"Unknown Origin\" element will be investigated further.",
