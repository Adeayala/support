In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* A user reported an issue with PiecesOS running slowly on their PC.\n* The issue was automatically triaged and routed to the appropriate team member.\n* The user was provided with links to related issues and helpful resources.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* PiecesOS running slowly on the user's PC.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The issue was routed to the appropriate team member for investigation and resolution.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The user is awaiting a follow-up from the Pieces team.\n* The issue is still open and being investigated.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* No specific solutions have been proposed or implemented yet.\n* The user may need to provide more information or troubleshooting steps to assist the team in resolving the issue.",
