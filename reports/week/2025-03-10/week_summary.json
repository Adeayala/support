In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## GitHub Issue Summary: Slow LTM Performance\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User @bpluly reported slow performance with Long Term Memory (LTM) on their PC.\n* The issue was automatically triaged and routed to the relevant Pieces team member.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* LTM performance is slow, even after updating to LTM-2.\n* Possible connection to other issues reported by users.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Related issues were suggested for reference:\n    - Long Term Memory slowing down PC (https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/650)\n    - PiecesOS launch failure (https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/624)\n    - Slow PiecesOS boot-up (https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/613)\n* Resources for self-help were provided:\n    - Existing Issues: https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues\n    - Documentation: https://docs.pieces.app\n    - YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@getpieces\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is being investigated by the Pieces team.\n* A follow-up is expected within 24 hours.\n\n**Note:** This summary is based on the information provided in the GitHub issue conversation up to March 14, 2025.",
