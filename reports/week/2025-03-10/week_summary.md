- **Investigate 'empty message' error**: This error appears in multiple contexts and platforms. Thoroughly test copy-paste functionality and recent updates to pinpoint the cause.
- **Gather more data on extension conflicts**: While the frequency is lower, extension issues can significantly impact user experience. Implement better error logging and user feedback mechanisms for extensions.
