Focus on improving compatibility with Windows App Installer, addressing potential conflicts with other software, and ensuring the application's security reputation.
- **Improve 'Secret Message' Functionality**: Ticket #652 reveals issues with the 'Secret Message' example. Address the bug causing strange responses from LLMs and ensure its functionality across different models like Claude and Gemini.
