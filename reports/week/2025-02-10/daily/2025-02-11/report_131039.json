They reported encountering varying errors, such as HandshakeException due to self-signed certificates, certificate verification failures, and general connection problems with the PiecesOS framework.\n* **Further investigation and resolution attempt:** Further examination revealed the problems experienced by Jason were related to a conflict with OneDrive. This conflict was resolved by removing related data from the application's folder within OneDrive. However, other users still encountering difficulties were advised to reach out to support or remove relevant database files if deemed empty. A future update was also promised to address the data migration issue, potentially preventing the problem from recurring.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nWhile the initial solution offered resolved some user experiences, the conversation highlights the complexity of troubleshooting issues in a distributed system due to diverse user experiences, configurations, and underlying causes. While user logs proved helpful in narrowing down potential problems, identifying a common solution for all scenarios involved multiple factors and required further investigation and communication between the support team and those affected. The promise of upcoming fixes for identified problems suggests that addressing these issues remains a work in progress for the support team.",
