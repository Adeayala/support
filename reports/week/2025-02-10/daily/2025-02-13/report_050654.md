## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS launch crash due to missing hardware support
Multiple users are experiencing crashes during Pieces OS launch after upgrading to version 11.1.1. The issue stems from the 'CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch' extension requiring AVX2 hardware support, which is missing on some systems. The Pieces team is aware of the problem and is actively working on a fix. A patch is expected to be released within 24-48 hours.
