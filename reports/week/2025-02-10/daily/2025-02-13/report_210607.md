## Common Issues
### 1. PiecesOS launch failure after version 11.1.1 update
Users reported PiecesOS failing to launch after updating to version 11.1.1 on both macOS and Windows. The issue stemmed from a new vector library requiring AVX2 processor support. The Pieces team acknowledged the issue, requested user logs, and released a patch within 48 hours to address the problem and restore functionality for affected users.

### 2. Pieces OS Desktop App Performance Issues
Users reported various performance issues with the Pieces OS desktop app, including high CPU usage, unresponsiveness, and failure to launch. These issues were linked to LTM-1 functionality, specific Linux Mint versions and accessibility settings, and stricter hardware requirements in newer app versions. Solutions involved disabling LTM-1, adjusting accessibility settings, and hotfixes/patches from the Pieces team.

### 3. Pieces OS fails to launch due to extension error
Multiple users reported Pieces OS failing to launch on Ubuntu and Windows. The error message points to a 'DatabaseException' related to the 'CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch' extension. This is likely due to hardware limitations, specifically a lack of AVX2 support. The Pieces team is aware of the issue and is working on a patch to address this, with a planned release within 24-48 hours.
