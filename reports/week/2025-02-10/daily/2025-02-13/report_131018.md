## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving launch issues:** The most frequent and active tickets indicate problems with Pieces OS launching, particularly after the 11.1.1 update. Focus on resolving these issues swiftly to minimize user disruption.
- **Address AVX2 compatibility:** Investigate and implement solutions for the AVX2 compatibility problems preventing launch on some systems. This could involve providing alternative builds or clear guidance on system requirements.
- **Improve performance on Linux:** Several reports highlight high CPU usage and unresponsiveness on Linux. Optimize Pieces OS performance on this platform to enhance user experience.
- **Gather detailed system information:**  Request users experiencing launch or performance issues to provide detailed system specifications and logs. This will aid in faster diagnosis and resolution.
- **Proactive communication:** Keep users informed about the status of known issues, planned fixes, and estimated timelines. This can be done through release notes, in-app notifications, or a dedicated status page.
- **Enhance documentation:** Update documentation to include clear system requirements, troubleshooting steps for common issues, and workarounds for known problems. This empowers users to self-resolve issues where possible.
- **Consider automated testing:** Implement automated testing to catch compatibility issues and performance regressions before release. This can help prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
