Previous version worked well. Attached is the crash report log.\n\nEnvironment: \n\n- OS MacOS 15.2\n- CPU Intel \n\n[trace.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18777512/trace.log)\n## Key points and summary of the GitHub issue conversation\n\n**Problem identified:**\n\n- The user \"@gonzososa\" was experiencing issues while launching the PiecesOS application on their macOS device.\n- The issue was caused by the inability to load the 'CouchbaseLiteVectorSearch' extension due to a lack of AVX2 support on the user's CPU.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n- The Pieces team acknowledged the issue and confirmed that they were working on solving it.\n- They informed the user that a new release with a possible solution would be available the following day and encouraged them to try it.\n- In addition, they requested information about the user's CPU to gain a better understanding of the problem.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n- It is unclear whether the issue was fully resolved with the new release as the conversation does not extend beyond the initial responses.\n- The user \"@hra42\" provided additional information about the root cause of the problem, indicating that CPUs before 2016/2017 are likely to face similar issues due to the AVX2 requirement.\n\nThis summary highlights the key points of the conversation while focusing on its most important details. However, it remains inconclusive regarding the final outcome for the specific user who reported the issue due to the lack of further updates.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize a hotfix for PiecesOS launch failures:** This issue is widespread, affecting both macOS and Windows users after the 11.1.1 update.  Fast resolution is critical to minimize user disruption.",
    "**Improve communication around known issues:**  Direct users to relevant GitHub issues and provide updates on the hotfix progress.  Consider a temporary banner on the PiecesOS website or within the application.",
    "**Investigate the root cause of AVX2 compatibility issues:** This impacts users with older CPUs and requires a long-term solution beyond a temporary hotfix.  Explore alternative implementations or provide clear guidance on minimum system requirements.",
    "**Gather more detailed system information during crash reporting:** This will aid in faster diagnosis and resolution of issues like the AVX2 incompatibility.",
    "**Consider a more robust testing process for future updates:** This will help catch major issues like the launch failures before they impact users."
