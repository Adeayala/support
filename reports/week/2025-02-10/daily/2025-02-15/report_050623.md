## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving the PiecesOS crash issue:** This issue is impacting users with older CPUs and has caused a spike in support tickets. Focusing on providing a permanent fix for this issue should be a top priority.
- **Improve communication around known issues:** Proactively communicate known issues like the AVX2 incompatibility to users, potentially through release notes or in-app messaging. This can help reduce user frustration and support tickets.
- **Consider CPU compatibility in future releases:**  Given the AVX2 issue, establish a robust testing process for new releases to ensure compatibility with a wider range of CPU models, preventing similar issues in the future.
- **Gather more detailed system information:**  Collect more detailed system information from users during the bug reporting process, such as CPU model and macOS version. This will help in faster diagnosis and resolution of issues.
- **Create a dedicated knowledge base article for the crash issue:**  Publish a detailed knowledge base article addressing the crash issue, including troubleshooting steps and workarounds. This can help users resolve the issue independently and reduce the load on support agents.
