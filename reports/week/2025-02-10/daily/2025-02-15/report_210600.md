## Common Issues
### 1. PiecesOS launch and performance issues
Users reported PiecesOS crashing after launch or experiencing high RAM/CPU usage. This was linked to hardware incompatibility with AVX2 instructions, particularly on older CPUs. The issue was addressed in version 11.1.2, which included a fix for AVX2 compatibility. Additionally, memory optimization features were implemented to improve resource management.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving 'PiecesOS launch and performance issues'**: This issue is the most frequent and impacts user experience significantly. Focus on addressing the root causes, such as hardware incompatibility and memory optimization.
- **Investigate reported high RAM/CPU usage**: While a fix was implemented in version 11.1.2, some users still experience this issue. Further investigation is needed to determine if it's a new variant or a persistent issue.
- **Improve communication about known issues**: Proactively communicate known issues and their solutions to users through release notes, FAQs, or in-app notifications. This can reduce support ticket volume.
- **Gather more detailed system information**: When users report issues, collect detailed system information (OS version, hardware specs, PiecesOS version) to help with faster diagnosis and resolution.
- **Consider a bug bounty program**: Incentivize users to report bugs and security vulnerabilities by offering rewards. This can help identify and address issues more quickly.
