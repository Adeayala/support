## Recommendations
- **Proactively address the PiecesOS launch failure:** With a patch expected soon, prepare support documentation and communication for users on how to access and apply the patch.  Consider a temporary FAQ or knowledge base article.
- **Investigate hardware requirement mismatch:** Analyze the logs from affected users to understand the specific hardware limitations causing the launch failures. This will help in tailoring the patch and future hardware requirement communication.
- **Improve error messaging:**  The current PiecesOS launch error should be made more user-friendly. Provide specific details about the issue (e.g., which hardware requirement is not met) and guidance on where to find more information or support.
