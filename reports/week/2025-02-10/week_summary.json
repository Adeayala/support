They increased server capacity to address the problem.\n* **New Build (11.1.1):** The Pieces team released a new build (11.1.1) addressing the major issues. Users were encouraged to update to this version for resolution.\n\n### Current Status/Outcome:\n\n* Most users seem to have had the issue resolved after installing the 11.1.1 build. \n* Some users, including JasonDWilson, still encountered problems with the new build. \n* The Pieces team offered further support and investigation for these users.\n\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The issue primarily affected Windows users.\n* The specific cause of the problem remains unclear.\n* Ongoing efforts are underway to investigate residual issues and further improve the application.",
