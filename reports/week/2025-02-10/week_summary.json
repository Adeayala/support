    "**Prioritize resolving PiecesOS launch failures:** This is the most pressing issue affecting users, particularly after the 11.1.1 update. Focus on resolving hardware compatibility issues, especially AVX2 support, to ensure a wider range of users can access PiecesOS.",
    "**Improve communication around updates:** Provide clear and detailed information about potential compatibility issues before and after updates. This could include system requirement checks, known issues, and workarounds.",
    "**Enhance hardware requirement documentation:** Clearly outline the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for PiecesOS on all supported platforms. This will help users avoid installation issues and ensure smoother onboarding.",
    "**Develop a system for early detection of widespread issues:** Implement monitoring and analysis tools to quickly identify spikes in support tickets related to specific issues. This will enable faster response times and proactive communication with affected users.",
    "**Consider creating a dedicated knowledge base article for launch failures:** Consolidate troubleshooting steps, FAQs, and workarounds for common launch issues in an easily accessible knowledge base article. This will empower users to resolve problems independently and reduce the load on support staff.",
    "**Gather detailed system information during support requests:** Streamline the process for users to share system specs and logs when reporting launch failures. This will help the support team diagnose and resolve issues more efficiently."
