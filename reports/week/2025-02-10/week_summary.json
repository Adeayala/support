We are trying to track down this issue, and would appreciate any feedback about your experience with this if you are experiencing it. \r\n\r\nWe have a hunch it has something to do with internet connections, but aren't fully sure yet. \r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing this and wouldn't mind hopping on a call with us to show us, we would really appreciate it to help us troubleshoot!

This slows down users' entire system and affects usability. \n* Some users suspect PiecesOS might be mining cryptocurrency in the background.\n\n### Problems Identified\n\n* High resource utilization makes PiecesOS unusable for some users.\n* The source of high resource usage is not clear, with some users attributing it to Live Context and others suspecting other factors like database technologies.\n\n### Solutions Proposed/Implemented\n\n* Turning off Live Context can reduce RAM usage. \n* Optimizing memory usage by unloading unused ML models can also help. \n* PiecesOS 11.1.0 replaced heavy database technologies to address memory and CPU issues.\n* Further improvements to reduce resource usage are in the pipeline.\n\n### Current Status/Outcome\n\n* Update 11.1.0 seems to have significantly improved CPU usage for some users.\n* However, some users are still experiencing high CPU usage, making PiecesOS unusable for them. \n* PiecesOS developers are actively working to address remaining resource usage concerns.",
