    "**Prioritize resolving launch failures:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around PiecesOS and Desktop App launch failures, particularly after the 11.1.1 update. Focus on resolving these issues urgently to reduce ticket influx.",
    "**Address hardware incompatibility:** Investigate and patch the AVX2 instruction set incompatibility causing launch failures for users on older hardware. Consider providing clear system requirements documentation.",
    "**Improve communication about known issues:**  The hardware incompatibility issue seems to have caught many users off guard. Proactively communicate known issues and workarounds, potentially through in-app notifications or a dedicated status page.",
    "**Investigate and address performance issues:** Several tickets report performance issues like slow boot-up and freezing. Allocate resources to diagnose and address these issues to improve the user experience.",
    "**Review PiecesOS update process:** The update to version 11.1.1 introduced significant issues. Review the update process to ensure smoother transitions and minimize breaking changes for users in the future.",
    "**Gather more detailed system information:** Encourage users to provide detailed system specs when reporting issues to aid in faster diagnosis and resolution. Consider automating this process through log collection or system profiling tools.",
    "**Consider a dedicated bug bounty program:** Given the recurrence of bugs like the conversation title saving issue, explore implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize users to report bugs and security vulnerabilities."
