    "**Prioritize resolving PiecesOS launch failures:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around PiecesOS failing to launch after the 11.1.1 update, particularly due to AVX2 incompatibility and issues on macOS. Focus on providing clear guidance for affected users, such as upgrading to 11.1.2 or reinstalling with the correct version for their architecture.",
    "**Improve communication about hardware requirements:** The launch failures highlight the need for clearer communication about PiecesOS's hardware requirements. Update the documentation and installation instructions to prominently feature these requirements, potentially including a system check tool.",
    "**Investigate and address PiecesOS boot-up issues:**  Users are experiencing issues with PiecesOS getting stuck during boot-up, specifically on the \"dependencies scenario\" tab. Investigate the root cause of this problem and provide a timely resolution.",
    "**Address high resource usage:** Some users report high RAM and CPU usage by PiecesOS. Investigate these reports, optimize resource utilization, and provide guidance on configuration options that could alleviate these issues.",
    "**Review and improve macOS compatibility:** A significant number of issues originate from macOS users, particularly those with M1 chips. Dedicate resources to thoroughly test and ensure compatibility with various macOS versions and architectures."
