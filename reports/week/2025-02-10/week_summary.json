    "**Prioritize resolution of Pieces OS launch failures:** The most frequent and active tickets relate to Pieces OS failing to launch, particularly on Apple Silicon Macs and Windows. Focus on identifying the root causes and implementing fixes to improve user experience.",
    "**Address Pieces App freezing issues:** Investigate and address the reports of the Pieces app freezing on Linux and Windows, specifically focusing on database errors and boot-up failures. This will improve the app's stability and usability.",
    "**Improve Visual Studio Extension compatibility:** Investigate the unexpected hotkey behavior in the Visual Studio Extension and find a solution that ensures consistent functionality across different IDE setups. This will enhance the extension's usability for developers.",
    "**Provide clear guidance on Apple Silicon vs. Intel builds:**  Given the recurring issue of users installing the incorrect build for their Mac architecture, prominently highlight the difference between Apple Silicon and Intel builds during the installation process. Consider adding in-app checks or prompts to prevent accidental mismatches.",
    "**Enhance communication and documentation:** Proactively communicate known issues and workarounds to users through release notes, FAQs, and in-app notifications. Ensure that documentation clearly outlines troubleshooting steps for common problems, including installation and launch issues.",
    "**Gather more detailed diagnostics:** Encourage users to provide detailed logs and system information when reporting issues to aid in faster diagnosis and resolution. This can be facilitated through in-app bug reporting tools or clear instructions on how to access and share relevant logs.",
    "**Consider automated triage and routing:** Implement a more robust system for automatically triaging incoming tickets and routing them to the appropriate support team members based on keywords, categories, and issue descriptions. This can help streamline the support process and reduce response times."
