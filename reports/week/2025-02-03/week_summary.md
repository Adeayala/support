## Recommendations
- **Prioritize account linking issues:** Many users are experiencing problems with account linking, particularly with Google and GitHub accounts. This issue has been persistent for some users, causing frustration and potentially impacting adoption. Focus on resolving the root cause of these account linking problems and improve the user experience for connecting multiple accounts.
- **Investigate and address Pieces OS update problems:** Several users reported issues after updating Pieces OS, including app crashes, launch failures, and download errors. These issues appear across different operating systems, suggesting a potential problem with the update process itself. Thoroughly test and address these issues to ensure a smooth update experience for all users.
- **Improve model download and installation process:** Users are encountering difficulties downloading and installing Ollama models, particularly on Linux due to sandboxing restrictions. Explore solutions like patching for sandbox compatibility, providing alternative download methods, or offering clearer instructions to resolve these issues and make model installation seamless.
- **Provide more detailed documentation and troubleshooting guides:** While the support bot offers helpful resources, expanding documentation and troubleshooting guides for common issues like account linking, update problems, and model installation can empower users to resolve problems independently and reduce the strain on support resources.
- **Consider a dedicated bug reporting and tracking system:** While GitHub Issues serve as a platform for reporting problems, a dedicated bug reporting and tracking system could provide a more structured approach to managing and prioritizing issues. This system could include features like issue templates, severity levels, and progress updates to improve communication and transparency with users.
