## Common Issues
### 1. Ollama Integration Issues with Pieces
Users are experiencing difficulties installing and using Ollama, particularly on Linux due to snap confinement issues and missing dependencies. Workarounds include manual installation, but a permanent fix involving dependency management and snap configuration is expected from the Pieces team.

### 2. Pieces OS Account Linking and Service Errors
Users report issues with linking multiple accounts (Google, GitHub) and accessing services like Copilot. Temporary solutions involve manual linking or waiting for a new account linking flow. Service errors often lack specific details, leading to generic troubleshooting suggestions and requests for follow-up from the Pieces team.
