## Common Issues
### 1. PiecesOS Startup and Account Linking Issues
Users report PiecesOS getting stuck during startup on the "dependencies scenario" screen, across Windows and MacOS.  Suggested workarounds include waiting, restarting, reinstalling, and checking log files. A potential fix was released with version 11.1.1.  Separately, users experience difficulty linking both Google and GitHub accounts simultaneously, with only one remaining active at a time.  This longstanding issue is linked to email capitalization inconsistencies and a legacy account linking system. A new system is planned for future release.
