## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop App Launch and Account Linking Issues
Users report issues with launching the Pieces Desktop app on Windows and macOS, often encountering errors related to core dependencies or OS migration.

Proposed solutions include waiting for migration completion, restarting the app, contacting support, and checking for updates.

### 2. PiecesOS Boot-up and Migration Issues
Users are experiencing difficulties booting PiecesOS after updating to version 11.1.0, often encountering a 'core dependencies' error. This is likely due to ongoing data migration in the new version.
