## Recommendations
- **Prioritize PiecesOS Startup Issues:** Focus on resolving the widespread issue of PiecesOS failing to launch after the 11.1.0 update, particularly the persistent problems on MacOS. Investigate data migration processes and installer inconsistencies.
- **Improve Ollama Download and Installation:** Address the difficulties users face when downloading and installing Ollama, including sandbox restrictions and dependency conflicts. Provide clearer instructions or automated solutions.
- **Investigate Account Linking Issues:** Address the persistent problem of users being unable to link both Google and GitHub accounts simultaneously. Prioritize the rollout of the new authentication system and ensure it resolves this issue.
- **Monitor PiecesOS 11.1.1 Adoption:** Encourage users to update to the latest version and monitor its effectiveness in resolving the reported startup and migration issues. Gather feedback from users still experiencing problems.
- **Improve Communication and Documentation:** Provide clear and concise communication to users regarding known issues, workarounds, and expected resolution times. Update documentation with troubleshooting steps for common problems like Ollama installation and account linking.
- **Review User Logs Proactively:** Implement a system to proactively review user logs for common error messages and patterns. This will help identify and address emerging issues before they become widespread.
- **Consider a Dedicated FAQ for PiecesOS:** Create a dedicated FAQ section on the Pieces website specifically for PiecesOS-related issues. Include answers to common questions, troubleshooting steps, and known issue workarounds.
- **Gather User Feedback on Localization:** Given the interest in French localization, consider conducting a survey or gathering feedback on other desired languages. This will help prioritize future localization efforts.
