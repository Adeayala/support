## Recommendations
- **Investigate and address the freezing issue on Linux:** This is the most pressing issue, impacting users with the desktop app on Linux (version 3.3.6, OS 11.1.1). Prioritize finding a solution and releasing a bug fix.
- **Improve communication with users experiencing issue #618:**  The high activity level suggests ongoing communication and potential frustration. Proactively update the user on the investigation progress and estimated resolution time.
- **Gather more detailed system information:**  To better understand and reproduce the freezing issue, collect additional information about the affected users' systems (e.g., specific Linux distribution, graphics drivers, available resources).
- **Consider creating a dedicated knowledge base article:**  Documenting the freezing issue and any potential workarounds in a public knowledge base can help affected users and potentially reduce the support ticket volume.
