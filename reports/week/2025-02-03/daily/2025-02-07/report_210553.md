This issue appears to affect both macOS and Windows users. Reinstalling the latest version of PiecesOS is the recommended solution.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize the 'PiecesOS Startup Failure' issue:** This issue is causing significant user friction and should be addressed with high priority. Investigate the root cause of the startup failure and provide a permanent fix.
- **Improve error messaging during startup:** The "ensure core dependency" message is not informative enough. Provide users with more specific error messages to help them troubleshoot the issue themselves.
- **Create a troubleshooting guide for startup issues:** Develop a comprehensive guide that users can refer to when they encounter startup problems. Include common causes, solutions, and steps to gather relevant logs for support.
- **Gather more system information:** Encourage users to provide system information and logs when reporting startup issues. This will help in diagnosing the problem more effectively.
- **Consider automated checks for core dependencies:** Implement checks during installation or updates to ensure all core dependencies are met. This can help prevent the startup failure from occurring in the first place.
- **Monitor the effectiveness of the latest PiecesOS update:** Track if the reported issue persists after users update to the latest version. If the issue is not resolved, further investigation and a new fix might be necessary.
