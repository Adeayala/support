But now the desktop app won't start anymore, being stuck on the core dependencies.\n\nI can click on the link, but nothing changes when I do that.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/716af38b-6a71-4162-80f8-b9e9e44f7059)\n## Summary of GitHub Issue #613: \"PiecesOS stuck on dependencies scenario\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The issue involves PiecesOS getting stuck on the \"dependencies scenario\" tab during startup.\n* This issue affects users on both Windows and macOS.\n* Some users report seeing the PiecesOS icon in the top bar for a brief period before it disappears.\n* The issue appears to be related to a major migration of data from the previous stack to the new stack in PiecesOS version 11.1.0.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The issue prevents users from accessing PiecesOS and using its features.\n* The cause of the issue is not entirely clear, with different users experiencing the problem under different circumstances.\n* The issue seems to be more prevalent on older hardware.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The PiecesOS team has released a new version (11.1.1) that claims to resolve the issue.\n* Users are advised to uninstall the previous version and reinstall version 11.1.1.\n* If the issue persists with version 11.1.1, users can follow up in the same thread and provide additional information.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue appears to be resolved for some users who have updated to version 11.1.1.\n* Other users are still experiencing the issue and are providing additional information to the PiecesOS team.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* It is important to distinguish between the issues reported by Shamas Habib and rogierlegit, as they are experiencing the problem under different operating systems.\n* The issue with Atlas OS is likely unrelated to the problem with PiecesOS.\n* Users are encouraged to provide as much information as possible, including logs and screenshots, to help the PiecesOS team diagnose the issue.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize the 'PiecesOS Startup Failure' issue:** This issue is causing significant user friction and should be addressed with high priority. Investigate the root cause of the startup failure and provide a permanent fix.",
    "**Improve error messaging during startup:** The \"ensure core dependency\" message is not informative enough. Provide users with more specific error messages to help them troubleshoot the issue themselves.",
    "**Create a troubleshooting guide for startup issues:** Develop a comprehensive guide that users can refer to when they encounter startup problems. Include common causes, solutions, and steps to gather relevant logs for support.",
    "**Gather more system information:** Encourage users to provide system information and logs when reporting startup issues. This will help in diagnosing the problem more effectively.",
    "**Consider automated checks for core dependencies:** Implement checks during installation or updates to ensure all core dependencies are met. This can help prevent the startup failure from occurring in the first place.",
    "**Monitor the effectiveness of the latest PiecesOS update:** Track if the reported issue persists after users update to the latest version. If the issue is not resolved, further investigation and a new fix might be necessary."
