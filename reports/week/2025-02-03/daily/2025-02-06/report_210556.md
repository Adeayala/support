## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS fails to launch after update
Users are reporting that the Pieces OS desktop application gets stuck during startup after an update. This issue appears on both Windows and MacOS, and the app hangs on the "dependencies scenario". Rebooting doesn't solve the problem. The Pieces team is investigating data migration as a potential cause and suggests allowing the app time to finish this process.
