### 1. Ollama Model Download and Installation Issues
Users are experiencing difficulties downloading and installing Ollama models within the Pieces desktop application. This issue appears to be prevalent on Linux systems, particularly those running Pieces via Snap, due to sandbox restrictions. Proposed solutions include modifying the Snap definition to include dependencies like 'curl' and allowing Pieces to access externally installed models.
