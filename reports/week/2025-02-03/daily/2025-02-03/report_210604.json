  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize 'Ollama Model Download and Installation Issues'**: This is the most frequent and impactful issue, particularly for Linux users. Focus on resolving the sandbox restrictions causing installation failures.",
    "**Investigate Snap Confinement Issues:** The root cause of the Ollama installation problem seems tied to Snap's sandboxing. Explore solutions like modifying the Snap definition or providing alternative installation methods for Linux.",
    "**Improve 'Pieces Copilot Service' Stability:** Address the 'Bad state' error preventing users from opening the Copilot service. This might involve reviewing service registration and dependencies.",
    "**Gather More Information on 'Models Download Fail':** While less active than other issues, investigate the root cause of model download failures on Windows. Analyze provided logs and request additional details from affected users if needed.",
    "**Consider a Dedicated FAQ or Troubleshooting Guide:** Given the recurring nature of these issues, create a dedicated FAQ or troubleshooting section in your documentation specifically addressing Ollama installation, model downloads, and Pieces Copilot Service errors on different operating systems."
