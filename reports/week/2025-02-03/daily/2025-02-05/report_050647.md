## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop App: Account Linking Issues
Users are unable to simultaneously link multiple accounts (e.g., Google, GitHub) due to a bug in the Pieces Desktop app. This issue has persisted for several years despite troubleshooting and support requests. A new account linking flow is planned for a future release. As a temporary solution, the Pieces team can manually merge user accounts upon request.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving account linking issues:** The most frequent issue is related to account linking, causing user frustration and increased support requests. Address the underlying bug and prioritize the new account linking flow implementation.
- **Improve documentation and communication around account linking:** Provide clear and concise instructions on how to link multiple accounts. Communicate the planned improvements and temporary solutions to users.
- **Monitor and analyze support tickets:** Regularly review support tickets to identify recurring issues and trends. This will help in proactively addressing problems and improving the overall user experience.
- **Consider a more robust account merging process:** Manually merging accounts can be time-consuming. Explore automated or more efficient solutions for merging accounts with potential linking issues.
- **Gather user feedback on the new account linking flow:** Before fully rolling out the new flow, gather user feedback through beta testing or surveys to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience.
