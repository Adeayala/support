A new account linking flow is planned for a future release. As a temporary solution, the Pieces team can manually merge user accounts upon request.",

          "text": "Pieces Desktop app, account linking never acheived for several years?\n### Software\n\nDesktop Application\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nWindows\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\n11.0.4\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [x] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\nI have been experiencing an issue with the Pieces Desktop app where I am unable to link both my Google and GitHub accounts simultaneously. Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User @johnkennyuk is experiencing issues with account linking in the Pieces app.\n* The current account linking flow is not user-friendly and is being actively worked on for replacement.\n* The user's current accounts seem to have been registered separately due to earlier bugs in the application.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The account linking flow is not straightforward and causes confusion.\n* User's two accounts are not properly linked, leading to issues.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* A new account linking flow is planned for mid-to-late February.\n* Mark from the Pieces team offered to manually merge the user's accounts.\n* The user's preferred account (Google account with custom domain) will be kept as the main account.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Mark from the Pieces team has identified the user's accounts and will proceed with merging them.\n* The user will need to sign out and sign back in after the merge to complete the account linking.\n* The new account linking flow is expected to be implemented in mid-to-late February.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The user and Mark from the Pieces team are communicating via GitHub comments.\n* The user is a senior IT engineer and feels confident in completing the remaining steps.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolving account linking issues:** The most frequent issue is related to account linking, causing user frustration and increased support requests. Address the underlying bug and prioritize the new account linking flow implementation.",
    "**Improve documentation and communication around account linking:** Provide clear and concise instructions on how to link multiple accounts. Communicate the planned improvements and temporary solutions to users.",
    "**Monitor and analyze support tickets:** Regularly review support tickets to identify recurring issues and trends. This will help in proactively addressing problems and improving the overall user experience.",
    "**Consider a more robust account merging process:** Manually merging accounts can be time-consuming. Explore automated or more efficient solutions for merging accounts with potential linking issues.",
    "**Gather user feedback on the new account linking flow:** Before fully rolling out the new flow, gather user feedback through beta testing or surveys to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience."
