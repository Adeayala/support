## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving account linking issues:** The most frequent and active support tickets are related to difficulties in linking multiple accounts, particularly Google and GitHub. This issue has persisted for several years for some users, causing frustration and hindering app adoption. Resolving this should be a top priority.
- **Improve Pieces OS update process:** Users are experiencing app malfunctions after updating Pieces OS. This suggests potential compatibility issues between the OS and desktop app versions. Implementing rigorous testing and compatibility checks before releasing OS updates can prevent such issues.
- **Enhance in-app guidance for account linking:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions within the app settings for linking and managing multiple accounts. This can reduce user errors and support tickets related to account linking.
- **Develop a more robust account merging solution:** The current process of manually merging accounts by the Pieces team is time-consuming and not scalable. Develop a self-service feature allowing users to merge accounts seamlessly and securely.
- **Consider a dedicated support channel for Pieces OS:** Given the specific issues related to Pieces OS updates, creating a dedicated support channel or knowledge base can help users troubleshoot problems more effectively.
- **Gather more detailed user feedback:** Encourage users to provide detailed feedback about their experience with the account linking process and OS updates. This feedback can provide valuable insights for further improvements and bug fixes.
- **Monitor support ticket trends:** Regularly analyze support ticket data to identify recurring issues, emerging trends, and areas for improvement in the product or support processes. This proactive approach can help address issues before they escalate and improve overall user satisfaction.
