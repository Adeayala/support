Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Issue:** Difficulty linking multiple accounts\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Current account linking process is not user-friendly and confusing.\n- Johnkennyuk is experiencing issues linking his Github and Google accounts.\n- Mark-at-pieces proposes a solution to merge johnkennyuk's accounts into his Google account.\n\n**Proposed/Implemented Solutions:**\n\n- Mark-at-pieces offers to schedule a call with johnkennyuk to resolve the issue.\n- Mark-at-pieces identifies the relevant accounts and proposes merging them into johnkennyuk's Google account.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n- Johnkennyuk agrees to merge his accounts into his Google account.\n- Mark-at-pieces will assist with the merging process once johnkennyuk confirms his preferred account.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The current account linking process is known to be buggy and will be replaced in the future.\n- Mark-at-pieces guarantees the accounts will be successfully linked after the merge.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolving account linking issues:** The most frequent and active support tickets are related to difficulties in linking multiple accounts, particularly Google and GitHub. This issue has persisted for several years for some users, causing frustration and hindering app adoption. Resolving this should be a top priority.",
    "**Improve Pieces OS update process:** Users are experiencing app malfunctions after updating Pieces OS. This suggests potential compatibility issues between the OS and desktop app versions. Implementing rigorous testing and compatibility checks before releasing OS updates can prevent such issues.",
    "**Enhance in-app guidance for account linking:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions within the app settings for linking and managing multiple accounts. This can reduce user errors and support tickets related to account linking.",
    "**Develop a more robust account merging solution:** The current process of manually merging accounts by the Pieces team is time-consuming and not scalable. Develop a self-service feature allowing users to merge accounts seamlessly and securely.",
    "**Consider a dedicated support channel for Pieces OS:** Given the specific issues related to Pieces OS updates, creating a dedicated support channel or knowledge base can help users troubleshoot problems more effectively.",
    "**Gather more detailed user feedback:** Encourage users to provide detailed feedback about their experience with the account linking process and OS updates. This feedback can provide valuable insights for further improvements and bug fixes.",
    "**Monitor support ticket trends:** Regularly analyze support ticket data to identify recurring issues, emerging trends, and areas for improvement in the product or support processes. This proactive approach can help address issues before they escalate and improve overall user satisfaction."
