          "text": "Pieces Desktop app, account linking never acheived for several years?\n### Software\n\nDesktop Application\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nWindows\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\n11.0.4\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [x] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\nI have been experiencing an issue with the Pieces Desktop app where I am unable to link both my Google and GitHub accounts simultaneously. Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User @johnkennyuk (@johnkennyuk) reported experiencing problems with Pieces account linking (\"current account linking flow is absolutely not up to par\").\n* This problem was confirmed by Pieces Support Bot (\"Thank you so much for creating this issue. Your issue has been automatically triaged and routed to the proper Pieces team member\").\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow in Pieces is problematic and unclear.\n* User @johnkennyuk encountered difficulty with linking multiple accounts. \n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Pieces Support proposes the following:\n    * Meeting for assistance with resolving account issues in the current system (not a permanent solution).\n    * Active development of replacement account linking flow to be launched mid to late February. \n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Issue remains open until the new account linking system is launched in Feburary.\n* User can potentially meet with Pieces Support or await the upcoming update for resolution.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The response identifies similar, potentially helpful existing issues and resources.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolving account linking issues:** The most frequent and active support ticket highlights persistent problems with account linking in the Pieces Desktop app. This issue should be addressed with high priority, either by expediting the development of the new account linking system or by allocating additional resources to assist users with the current system.",
    "**Improve communication about known issues:** Proactively communicate the known issue with account linking and the expected resolution timeline (February) to users through release notes, FAQs, or in-app messaging. This can help manage user expectations and reduce support tickets related to this issue.",
    "**Gather more data on account linking problems:** Analyze the specific steps users take when encountering account linking issues to identify common pain points and areas for improvement in the current and future systems.",
    "**Consider a bug bounty program:** Given the long-standing nature of the account linking issue, consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize users to report bugs and help identify solutions more quickly.",
    "**Review support ticket routing:** Ensure that support tickets are automatically routed to the appropriate team members based on the category and keywords to expedite resolution times.",
    "**Track resolution times for different categories:** Monitor the time it takes to resolve tickets in different categories, such as \"bug\", \"os:windows\", and \"app:desktop application\", to identify areas where support processes can be optimized."
