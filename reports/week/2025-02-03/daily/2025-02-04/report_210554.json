A new account linking flow is under development and expected in early 2025. As a temporary solution, users can schedule a meeting with Pieces support for manual account linking.",

          "text": "Pieces Desktop app, account linking never acheived for several years?\n### Software\n\nDesktop Application\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nWindows\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\n11.0.4\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [x] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\nI have been experiencing an issue with the Pieces Desktop app where I am unable to link both my Google and GitHub accounts simultaneously. Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Linking Accounts in Pieces\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User (@johnkennyuk) reported an issue with the account linking flow in Pieces.\n* The current account linking flow is inadequate and not user-friendly.\n* Pieces is actively working on a replacement for the account linking flow, planned for mid to late February 2025.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not clear and straightforward.\n* It is difficult for users to link multiple accounts.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* A new account linking flow is being developed.\n* A Pieces team member offered to manually link the user's accounts in the meantime.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The new account linking flow is not yet available but is expected in mid to late February 2025.\n* The user can schedule a meeting with a Pieces team member to have their accounts manually linked.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolving account linking issues:** This is a recurring problem affecting users for a long time. Address the root cause and prioritize the new account linking flow development.",
    "**Improve account linking documentation:** Provide clear and detailed instructions on how to link multiple accounts, emphasizing the current limitations and workarounds.",
    "**Consider a temporary solution for manual account linking:**  While the new flow is under development, offer a more streamlined process for manual linking, perhaps through a dedicated form or automated system.",
    "**Monitor and analyze feedback:**  Regularly review support tickets and community discussions to identify and address emerging issues proactively.",
    "**Communicate proactively about the new account linking flow:** Keep users informed about the progress and expected release date of the new flow to manage expectations."
