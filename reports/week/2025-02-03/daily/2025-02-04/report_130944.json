This issue has persisted for several years across multiple app versions and OS updates. A new account linking flow is under development to address this. As a temporary solution, users can schedule a meeting with the Pieces team for assistance.",

          "text": "Pieces Desktop app, account linking never acheived for several years?\n### Software\n\nDesktop Application\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nWindows\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\n11.0.4\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [x] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\nI have been experiencing an issue with the Pieces Desktop app where I am unable to link both my Google and GitHub accounts simultaneously. Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not user-friendly and needs to be replaced.\n* John Kenny raised an issue regarding this problem.\n* Pieces team is aware of the issue and is actively working on a replacement.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The existing account linking flow is not straightforward.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* A new account linking flow is being developed and will be implemented in mid to late February.\n* In the meantime, the user can schedule a meeting with Mark (mark@pieces.app) to resolve the issue.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The new account linking flow is under development.\n* The user can schedule a meeting with Mark to resolve the issue in the meantime.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The user can refer to the existing issues and documentation for more information.\n* The user can also subscribe to the Pieces YouTube channel for updates.",
