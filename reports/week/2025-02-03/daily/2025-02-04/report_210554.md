## Common Issues
### 1. Account Linking Issues in Pieces Desktop App
Users are unable to simultaneously link multiple accounts, such as Google and GitHub, in the Pieces Desktop app. This issue has persisted for several years despite troubleshooting and support interaction. A new account linking flow is under development and expected in early 2025. As a temporary solution, users can schedule a meeting with Pieces support for manual account linking.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving account linking issues:** This is a recurring problem affecting users for a long time. Address the root cause and prioritize the new account linking flow development.

- **Consider a temporary solution for manual account linking:**  While the new flow is under development, offer a more streamlined process for manual linking, perhaps through a dedicated form or automated system.
- **Monitor and analyze feedback:**  Regularly review support tickets and community discussions to identify and address emerging issues proactively.
- **Communicate proactively about the new account linking flow:** Keep users informed about the progress and expected release date of the new flow to manage expectations.
