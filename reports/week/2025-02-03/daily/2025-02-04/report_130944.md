| [#610](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/610) | Pieces Desktop app, account linking never acheived for several years? | 5.68 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Simultaneous Google and GitHub account linking issue
Users are unable to link both Google and GitHub accounts to the Pieces Desktop app concurrently. Attempting to link both results in one account being unlinked. This issue has persisted for several years across multiple app versions and OS updates. A new account linking flow is under development to address this. As a temporary solution, users can schedule a meeting with the Pieces team for assistance.
