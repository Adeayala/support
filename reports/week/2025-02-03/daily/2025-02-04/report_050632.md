- **Consider a bug bounty program:** Given the long-standing nature of the account linking issue, consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize users to report bugs and help identify solutions more quickly.
- **Review support ticket routing:** Ensure that support tickets are automatically routed to the appropriate team members based on the category and keywords to expedite resolution times.
- **Track resolution times for different categories:** Monitor the time it takes to resolve tickets in different categories, such as "bug", "os:windows", and "app:desktop application", to identify areas where support processes can be optimized.
