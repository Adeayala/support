Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Conversation Summary:\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* The account linking flow in Pieces is not working properly.\n* This is causing issues for users who want to link their GitHub and Google accounts.\n* The current auth service provider is being replaced with a new one in the coming weeks.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* The account linking flow is not straightforward.\n* There is a bug in the old auth service provider that is preventing accounts with different capitalization in their email addresses from being linked.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Mark from Pieces offered to manually merge the user's accounts.\n* Mark also reset the user's GitHub account.\n* The user will wait for the new auth service provider to be implemented.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The user's accounts have not been merged.\n* The user will wait for the new auth service provider to be implemented.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The new auth service provider will be able to link accounts with different email addresses.\n* The new auth service provider is expected to be ready for production by the end of February 2025.",
