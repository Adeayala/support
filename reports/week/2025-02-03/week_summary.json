Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk reported the inability to link his personal domain and Google account.\n* He preferred the Google account to be the main account.\n* He was prompted to go through the account linking flow several times, but it did not work.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow was not straightforward and had bugs.\n* Potential capital letter inconsistency in email addresses causing misalignment.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark-at-pieces offered to manually merge the accounts.\n* Johnkennyuk preferred resolving through GitHub and provided additional information.\n* Mark-at-pieces reset Johnkennyuk's GitHub account and offered to test with disabled email privacy.\n* Johnkennyuk proposed waiting for the new authentication service expected at the end of February.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue with linking accounts remained unresolved.\n* Johnkennyuk agreed to wait for the new authentication service rollout.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new authentication service is expected to handle account linking more efficiently and address the email inconsistency issue.\n* Mark-at-pieces apologized for the inconvenience and thanked Johnkennyuk for his patience.",
