Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* John encounters issues linking his Github and Google accounts on the Pieces platform.\n* He creates a GitHub issue, which is automatically triaged and routed to the Pieces support team.\n* Mark, a Pieces team member, responds and identifies the account linking flow as the problem.\n* A temporary solution is offered to resolve the immediate issue, but a permanent fix is expected by the end of February.\n* John prefers to wait for the new system due to ongoing issues with the current system.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Account linking flow is not working properly.\n* There is a minor inconsistency in the email capitalization between John's Github and Google accounts.\n* The current authentication service has limitations, causing occasional annoyances.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Temporary solution: Mark offers to manually merge John's accounts and resolve the immediate issue.\n* Permanent solution: Pieces is developing a new authentication service that will address the account linking issues and enable linking different types of accounts.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The temporary solution wasn't successful due to the capitalization issue.\n* John decides to wait for the new authentication service to be released.\n* The new system is expected to be ready by the end of February.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of communication and collaboration between developers and users.\n* The new authentication service is expected to improve the overall user experience.",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* John encounters issues linking his Github and Google accounts on the Pieces platform.\n* He creates a GitHub issue, which is automatically triaged and routed to the Pieces support team.\n* Mark, a Pieces team member, responds and identifies the account linking flow as the problem.\n* A temporary solution is offered to resolve the immediate issue, but a permanent fix is expected by the end of February.\n* John prefers to wait for the new system due to ongoing issues with the current system.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Account linking flow is not working properly.\n* There is a minor inconsistency in the email capitalization between John's Github and Google accounts.\n* The current authentication service has limitations, causing occasional annoyances.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Temporary solution: Mark offers to manually merge John's accounts and resolve the immediate issue.\n* Permanent solution: Pieces is developing a new authentication service that will address the account linking issues and enable linking different types of accounts.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The temporary solution wasn't successful due to the capitalization issue.\n* John decides to wait for the new authentication service to be released.\n* The new system is expected to be ready by the end of February.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of communication and collaboration between developers and users.\n* The new authentication service is expected to improve the overall user experience.",
