Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Merging Accounts\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User @johnkennyuk is experiencing account linking issues with two separate accounts: Github and Google.\n* User would like to merge accounts with Google as the main account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow is \"not up to par\" and will be replaced by mid-to-late February.\n* Minor capitalization inconsistency exists between registered emails (Github email has lowercase first character, Google email has uppercase first character).\n* New authorization service is being implemented which might solve the issue permanently.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Pieces Support engineer (@mark-at-pieces) offered to manually merge accounts.\n* User's Github account was reset by @mark-at-pieces.\n* Suggestion to temporarily disable email privacy setting on Github account.\n* Email capitalization inconsistency will be addressed.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Manual merge was unsuccessful due to capitalization issue.\n* User decided to wait for the new authorization service to be implemented in the coming weeks.\n\n**Actionable Insights:**\n\n* New authorization service might offer a permanent fix for account linking issues.\n* Developer might not be properly adhering to best practices for email address handling with regard to case sensitivity.\n\n\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nDespite efforts from support, merging accounts manually was ultimately unsuccessful. However, the upcoming introduction of a new authorization service provides promising prospects for a definitive resolution within the next few weeks.",
