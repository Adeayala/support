Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User (@johnkennyuk) reported issues with the account linking process, finding it unclear and difficult to use.\n* The user provided additional details about their specific situation involving two accounts.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not user-friendly and requires improvement.\n* The user experienced difficulties linking their two accounts.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* The Pieces team acknowledged the problem and confirmed that they are working on a replacement for the current account linking flow.\n* The team offered a temporary solution for the user to meet with a support representative (mark-at-pieces) to solve the issue with their specific accounts.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The new account linking flow is scheduled to be implemented mid to late February 2025.\n* The user can connect with mark-at-pieces to resolve their specific account linking issue in the meantime.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The conversation took place on February 4, 2025.\n* The user was directed to helpful resources including existing issues, documentation, and the Pieces YouTube channel.",
