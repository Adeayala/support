Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## GitHub Issue Summary: Account Linking Problem\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User johnkennyuk reported an issue with account linking not working properly.\n* This issue seems to be caused by a capitalization difference in the first character of the email address associated with the user's Github account compared to their Google account.\n* The user prefers to keep their Google account as the main account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not user-friendly and not functioning properly.\n* A capitalization difference in the first character of the email address is causing the accounts to not link correctly.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The user's Github account was reset to allow for another attempt at linking accounts.\n* The user was advised to check their Github account settings to ensure email privacy settings are disabled.\n* The user was advised to manually adjust the capitalization of the first character in their Github account email to match their Google account email.\n* The company is actively developing a new authentication service that will address these issues and enable linking of different accounts with varying email addresses.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The user's accounts are still not linked due to the capitalization difference in the email address.\n* The user has decided to wait for the new authentication service to be implemented before attempting to link their accounts again.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new authentication service is expected to be ready for production by the end of February 2025.\n* The company is confident that the new service will resolve the account linking issues.\n\n\nI hope this summary is helpful. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.",
