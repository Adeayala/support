Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User (@johnkennyuk) is experiencing issues with account linking and wants to merge their Github and Google accounts.\n* User identified that they should have only one account, but due to previous bugs, two accounts were created.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow is not user-friendly.\n* User has two separate accounts instead of one.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Mark from Pieces Support will manually merge the two accounts.\n* The user's Google account with the custom domain will be the main account.\n* User will need to sign out and sign back in after the merge.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Mark from Pieces Support has identified the user's accounts and the main account has been determined.\n* User will need to provide the second email address to complete the merge.\n* Once the merge is complete, the user will no longer experience issues with account linking.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The user is comfortable with the merge process and is confident they will be able to complete it successfully.\n* The issue will be resolved once the user provides the second email address and the merge is completed.",

Explore solutions like patching for sandbox compatibility, providing alternative download methods, or offering clearer instructions to resolve these issues and make model installation seamless.",
    "**Provide more detailed documentation and troubleshooting guides:** While the support bot offers helpful resources, expanding documentation and troubleshooting guides for common issues like account linking, update problems, and model installation can empower users to resolve problems independently and reduce the strain on support resources.",
    "**Consider a dedicated bug reporting and tracking system:** While GitHub Issues serve as a platform for reporting problems, a dedicated bug reporting and tracking system could provide a more structured approach to managing and prioritizing issues. This system could include features like issue templates, severity levels, and progress updates to improve communication and transparency with users."
