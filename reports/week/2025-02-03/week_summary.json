Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Account Linking Issues\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk, a Pieces user, reported facing difficulties linking his GitHub and Google accounts.\n* Existing account linking flow was identified as complex and not user-friendly.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The system wrongly registered Johnkennyuk's Gmail and GitHub accounts as separate due to slight inconsistencies in the capitalized first letter of the email address.\n* The existing account linking flow was not handling the inconsistency effectively.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark, a Pieces support member, offered to manually merge the accounts.\n* Johnkennyuk requested to keep his Google account with the associated custom domain as the primary account.\n* Mark attempted to resolve the issue by resetting Johnkennyuk's GitHub account and advising him to temporarily disable email privacy settings on GitHub.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The account linking process remained unsuccessful due to the capitalized first letter difference between the email addresses.\n* Both parties agreed to wait for the new auth service provider to be implemented, expected to be ready by the end of February 2025. This new system is expected to handle such inconsistencies more effectively.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of email address standardization and normalization during user account linking processes.\n* The Pieces team is actively working on improving the user experience and resolving current limitations.",
