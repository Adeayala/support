Alternatively, a system restart might help as well.\n* **Trying the alternative app installer**: Mark at Pieces suggested trying the appInstaller build to see if it resolved the issues faced by some users.\n* **Uninstalling and reinstalling PiecesOS**: Nathan at Pieces suggested uninstalling and reinstalling PiecesOS to potentially fix the incomplete launch issues experienced by Jason and Shamas.\n* **Providing system information**: Nathan also requested additional information such as the user's location, CPU name and version, and screenshots of specific files to help diagnose the problem further.\n* **Updating to version 11.1.1**: Mark at Pieces announced a new build (11.1.1) addressing the reported issues. Users were encouraged to update and report any remaining problems.\n\n### Current Status/Outcome:\n\n* **Potential resolution for long boot time**: Restarting PiecesOS or updating to version 11.1.1 might resolve the long boot time issue.\n* **Mixed results for incomplete launches**: While Shamas confirmed the update to 11.1.1 fixed their issue, Jason reported that the problem persisted for them even after updating.\n* **Handshake error**: The solution for the handshake error experienced by Shamas remains unclear, but location or server access issues may be potential causes.\n* **Need for further investigation**: Additional investigation is needed to understand the root cause and potential solutions for Jason's issue with incomplete launches.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* This summary primarily focuses on the issues raised and discussed on February 5th and 6th, 2025, within the GitHub issue thread.\n* The summary is intended to provide a concise overview of the key points, problems, solutions, and current status of the reported issues. \n* Further information and context may be available within the full GitHub issue thread for those interested in a deeper understanding of the discussions and solutions.",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* @johnkennyuk experienced issues linking their personal and Github accounts.\n* Account linking flow was identified as cumbersome and needing replacement.\n* Capitalization inconsistency in email addresses was suspected as a potential cause.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow was not user-friendly.\n* Capitalization difference in registered email addresses potentially prevented proper merging.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark from Pieces offered to personally merge the accounts through a meeting or email exchange.\n* Screen recording was requested from @johnkennyuk to identify further issues.\n* New auth service was mentioned to be in progress for smoother linking and email handling.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Temporary account linking solution provided through manual merging.\n* Resolution postponed to new auth service rollout (end of February 2025).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation highlights the importance of email case sensitivity during account linking.\n* There was an acknowledgment of the inconvenience caused by the current system and assurance of improvement with the upcoming new service.",
