Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Subject**: Unable to Link Accounts\n\n**Key Points**:\n\n- User (@johnkennyuk) reported issues with linking their Pieces accounts, calling the process \"not straightforward.\"\n- Pieces support bot responded with acknowledgement and suggested related issues and resources.\n- Mark from Pieces acknowledged the issue and explained that they are actively working on a replacement linking flow, expected in mid to late February 2025.\n- Mark offered a personal meeting to resolve the issue in the meantime.\n\n**Problems Identified**:\n\n- The current account linking flow is inadequate and user-unfriendly.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented**:\n\n- A new account linking flow is under development and scheduled for implementation in mid to late February 2025.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome**:\n\n- The user's issue is temporarily unresolvable until the new linking flow is released, but a workaround via a meeting with Mark has been offered. The issue remains open until the solution is implemented.",
