Account linking, particularly with Google and GitHub, is also problematic, with users unable to link both simultaneously. Proposed solutions include waiting for migration completion, restarting the app, contacting support, and checking for updates.",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* The current account linking flow in Pieces is not working properly.\n* The user (johnkennyuk) has two accounts, one linked to his GitHub and one to his Google account, and wants to merge them.\n* The user has a custom domain set up on his Google account, which he wants to keep as the main account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The account linking flow is not straightforward and is currently being replaced.\n* There appears to be a capitalization mismatch in the email addresses associated with the user's accounts.\n* The old authentication service provider does not handle linking accounts with different capitalization in emails.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark from Pieces offered to manually merge the accounts.\n* Mark suggested the user take a screen recording of the account linking flow.\n* Mark reset the user's GitHub account and suggested disabling the \"email privacy setting\" on GitHub.\n* Mark suggested waiting for the new authentication service to be implemented at the end of the month.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is still ongoing. \n* The user will wait for the new authentication service to be implemented before attempting to merge the accounts again.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new authentication service is expected to be ready within the next few weeks.\n* The new service will allow linking accounts with different capitalization in emails.\n\n## Overall, \n \nthe issue is not yet resolved, but there are promising solutions in the works. The user is advised to wait for the new authentication service before attempting to merge their accounts again.",
