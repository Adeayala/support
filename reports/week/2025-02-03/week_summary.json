Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User (@johnkennyuk) encountered difficulties linking their Google and GitHub accounts in Pieces. \n* Current account linking flow was described as \"not straightforward\".\n* A bug from early versions might have resulted in separate account registration.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Account linking flow not working as intended. \n* Potential mismatch between capitalisation of emails used in different platforms.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Merge the two accounts into one, keeping Google account as primary. \n* User advised to sign-out and sign back in to trigger account linking. \n* Reset the user's GitHub account.\n* Temporary disabling email privacy setting in GitHub suggested.\n* New auth service planned for deployment at month's end, allowing better linking and resolving capitalization issues.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Merging accounts failed. \n* User decided to wait for the new auth system implementation due to recurring issue and planned improvement.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* User expressed appreciation for prompt support. \n* Developer acknowledged limitations of current auth service and provided information about future updates.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize PiecesOS Startup Issues:** Focus on resolving the recurring problems with PiecesOS failing to launch or connect, particularly the \"core dependencies\" issue affecting both macOS and Windows users. This appears to be a major pain point.",
    "**Improve Account Linking:** Investigate and fix the persistent issue with simultaneous Google and GitHub account linking. Consider simplifying the account linking process based on user feedback.",
    "**Address Ollama Installation Challenges:** Provide clear solutions for Ollama installation issues, specifically addressing Snap environment conflicts and model download failures. This is crucial for users who rely on local LLM capabilities.",
    "**Enhance Communication on Known Issues:**  Keep users informed about the status of known issues, such as the French localization request and localhost errors. Provide timelines for resolutions or workarounds when possible.",
    "**Review Pieces for Developers Onboarding:** Given the localhost and Pieces OS launch issues, review the onboarding process for Pieces for Developers to ensure users have clear instructions and troubleshooting steps.",
    "**Gather More Data on ARM Mac Issues:** Investigate if the PiecesOS boot issues disproportionately affect M1/M2 Macs. If so, prioritize solutions for this user group.",
    "**Analyze Server Connection Logs:**  Review server connection logs to identify any patterns or recurring issues related to PiecesOS startup or cloud connectivity problems.",
    "**Consider a Bug Bounty Program:** To address issues like the account linking problem that has persisted for years, consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize community contributions to bug discovery and resolution."
