Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary: Account Linking Issues\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* **Current account linking process is not user-friendly and confusing.**\n* **User is experiencing issues linking their Google and Github accounts.**\n* **The issue appears to be related to capitalization inconsistency in emails.**\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* **Existing account linking process is outdated and cumbersome.**\n* **User's Google and Github email addresses differ slightly due to a capital letter.**\n* **Current authentication service provider has limitations.**\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* **Manual intervention by support team to merge accounts.**\n* **Resetting user's Github account.**\n* **Temporary disabling of email privacy settings on Github.**\n* **Implementation of a new authentication service provider in the near future.**\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* **User's accounts are temporarily merged, but the issue persists.**\n* **User is awaiting the implementation of the new authentication service.**\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new authentication service is expected to be ready in production around the end of the month.\n* The new service will allow for more seamless account linking, including accounts with different email addresses.\n\n**Overall, the support team is actively addressing the account linking issues and is working towards a more user-friendly solution in the near future.**",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize resolution of PiecesOS startup failures:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around PiecesOS failing to launch or getting stuck during startup. This issue appears across different operating systems and versions, suggesting a potentially widespread problem requiring immediate attention.",
    "**Investigate and address Ollama installation issues:** Multiple reports indicate difficulties installing Ollama, particularly on Linux. This impacts a key feature and requires a prompt resolution to improve user experience.",
    "**Improve account linking process:** Users report long-standing issues with account linking, particularly with Google and GitHub. Simplifying this process and ensuring its reliability will significantly reduce user frustration.",
    "**Provide clear guidance on PiecesOS update procedures:** Issues arising from updates, including boot failures and compatibility problems, suggest a need for clearer communication and user-friendly instructions for updating PiecesOS.",
    "**Enhance error messaging and logging:** Many users struggle to identify the root cause of their problems. Improving error messages and providing more detailed logs will empower users to troubleshoot independently or provide more informative reports to support.",
    "**Consider expanding support channels:** While GitHub issues serve as a platform for reporting, offering additional support channels like live chat or a dedicated forum could enhance responsiveness and user satisfaction.",
    "**Proactively monitor for common issues:** Implement systems to detect spikes in specific error reports or frequently mentioned issues. This allows for quicker identification of widespread problems and faster development of solutions or workarounds.",
    "**Develop and maintain comprehensive troubleshooting documentation:** Create a publicly accessible knowledge base or FAQ section addressing common issues, providing step-by-step solutions, and offering workarounds for known problems. This empowers users to resolve issues independently and reduces the support team's workload.",
    "**Gather user feedback on support experience:** Regularly solicit feedback from users regarding their support interactions. This provides valuable insights into areas for improvement and helps tailor support processes to better meet user needs."
