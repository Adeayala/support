Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not functioning properly.\n* Several similar issues have been reported.\n* User is experiencing difficulty linking their Github account to their Pieces account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Account linking flow is outdated and not straightforward.\n* Potential issue with email case sensitivity.\n* Existing bugs in the authentication process.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* **By Pieces Support:**\n    * Offered to resolve the issue through a call or email.\n    * Provided suggestions for account linking and merging.\n    * Suggested a solution based on the new authentication service.\n    * Reset the user's Github user account.\n    * Temporarily disabled email privacy on the user's Github account.\n    * Advised the user to wait for the new authentication service.\n* **By User:**\n    * Suggested waiting for the new authentication service to be implemented.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is currently unresolved.\n* The user is waiting for the new authentication service to be released.\n* Pieces Support is confident that the new authentication service will resolve the issue.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new authentication service is expected to be ready by the end of February 2025.\n* It is unclear if existing data will be migrated to the new authentication service.\n\n\n**Overall, this conversation highlights the challenges associated with the current account linking process. The implementation of the new authentication service is expected to resolve these issues and streamline the user experience.**",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* The current account linking flow is not functioning properly.\n* Several similar issues have been reported.\n* User is experiencing difficulty linking their Github account to their Pieces account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Account linking flow is outdated and not straightforward.\n* Potential issue with email case sensitivity.\n* Existing bugs in the authentication process.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* **By Pieces Support:**\n    * Offered to resolve the issue through a call or email.\n    * Provided suggestions for account linking and merging.\n    * Suggested a solution based on the new authentication service.\n    * Reset the user's Github user account.\n    * Temporarily disabled email privacy on the user's Github account.\n    * Advised the user to wait for the new authentication service.\n* **By User:**\n    * Suggested waiting for the new authentication service to be implemented.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue is currently unresolved.\n* The user is waiting for the new authentication service to be released.\n* Pieces Support is confident that the new authentication service will resolve the issue.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new authentication service is expected to be ready by the end of February 2025.\n* It is unclear if existing data will be migrated to the new authentication service.\n\n\n**Overall, this conversation highlights the challenges associated with the current account linking process. The implementation of the new authentication service is expected to resolve these issues and streamline the user experience.**",
