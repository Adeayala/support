Another common problem is the failure to install or open Pieces Copilot Service due to missing dependencies or sandbox restrictions. Lastly, users face difficulties installing Ollama on Linux due to the unavailability of 'curl' in the Pieces OS snap package. Solutions involve account merging, updating snap dependencies, and resolving sandbox limitations.",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n### Key Points:\n* Johnkennyuk reported an issue with the account linking flow in the Pieces app.\n* The current flow is not user-friendly and needs to be replaced.\n\n### Problems Identified:\n* The account linking flow is not straightforward.\n* Johnkennyuk is having trouble managing two separate accounts.\n* There were bugs in earlier versions of the app that caused separate account registrations.\n\n### Solutions Proposed/Implemented:\n* Mark from the Pieces team offered to help John directly by merging his accounts.\n* A replacement for the current account linking flow is being developed and will be deployed mid-to-late February.\n\n### Current Status/Outcome:\n* Mark has identified John's accounts and will merge them.\n* John's preferred account (Google account) will be kept as the main one.\n* John will need to sign out and back in again to use the merged account.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n* The issue is currently being handled directly through GitHub and email between John and Mark.\n* John has expressed confidence in his ability to use the merged account despite being an IT engineer.",
