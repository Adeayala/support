Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User (`johnkennyuk`) encountering issues linking their GitHub and Google accounts.\n* Old account linking flow identified as not ideal & being replaced in February.\n* A merge of the two accounts proposed through various attempts with email verification and sign-in/out steps.\n* Persistence of the issue leads to user waiting for the new system instead.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing account linking flow is dysfunctional and a replacement is underway.\n* Potentially conflicting capitalization differences in user's emails were suspected.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Proposed merging accounts: user's Google (with custom domain) as main and keeping username for signing-in via GitHub.\n* Temporary Google email privacy disable suggested for testing compatibility.\n* Issue acknowledged as persistent & attributed to the existing and soon to be replaced auth service.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Account linking attempted repeatedly but ultimately unsuccessful with the existing system due to possible caps sensitivity.\n* User opted to pause further attempts and await the implementation of the new auth system at the end of February for a potential fix.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation showcased good customer support by the Pieces representative, although the existing limitations prevented a resolution at this time.",
