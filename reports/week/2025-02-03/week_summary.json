Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User @johnkennyuk reported an issue with account linking.\n* The current account linking flow is not user-friendly and a replacement is being actively developed.\n* A temporary solution is offered by @mark-at-pieces to manually link accounts.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking process is not straightforward and user-friendly. \n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* A new account linking flow is being developed and will be released in mid-to-late February.\n* A temporary solution is offered by @mark-at-pieces to manually link accounts through a scheduled meeting.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The new account linking flow is under development.\n* Users can contact @mark-at-pieces for a temporary solution.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The issue author was directed to relevant resources, including existing issues, documentation, and the Pieces YouTube channel.",
