The error message points to an issue with the port configuration in the URL \"http://127.0.0.1:null/connect\" or \"http://0.0.0.0:null/connect\".  Troubleshooting steps like restarting and reinstalling the app have proven ineffective. The Pieces team is actively investigating the issue and gathering user logs for analysis. A potential solution involves a scheduled video call for live troubleshooting with affected users.",
