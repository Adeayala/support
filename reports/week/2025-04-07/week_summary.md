## Common Issues
### 1. Antivirus software falsely flags Pieces OS as a virus
Multiple users report antivirus software (Kaspersky, Nod32, Malwarebytes, ESET) blocking Pieces OS downloads or flagging it as malicious. This is likely due to Pieces' newness and its writing of files to the user Documents directory. Workarounds include adding Pieces to the antivirus allowlist or downloading from the Microsoft Store. The Pieces team is working on a permanent solution.

## Recommendations
- Investigate why antivirus software is flagging Pieces OS and work with vendors (Kaspersky, Nod32, Malwarebytes, ESET) to resolve the false positives.
- Provide clear and concise instructions on how to whitelist Pieces OS in common antivirus software.
- Explore giving users the option to change the installation directory for Pieces OS to avoid writing to the user Documents directory.
- Consider prioritizing the development of a permanent solution to prevent false positive detections by antivirus software.
- Monitor the effectiveness of the Microsoft Store as an alternative download source and promote it if it significantly reduces antivirus issues.
