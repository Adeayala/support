## Recommendations
- **Proactively address antivirus compatibility:** Investigate and resolve the false positive detections by antivirus software like Kaspersky, Nod32, and Malwarebytes. This could involve reaching out to antivirus vendors and/or refining Pieces OS's code or installation process.
- **Improve error messaging:** The "Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect" error message is unclear for users. Provide more user-friendly guidance, potentially suggesting antivirus interference as a possible cause.
- **Document workarounds:** Clearly document workarounds for known issues, such as adding Pieces OS to antivirus allow lists or downloading from the Microsoft Store. Make this information easily accessible to users.
- **Monitor and analyze common issues:** Continuously track and analyze common issues to identify trends and prioritize solutions. This will help to proactively address recurring problems and improve the overall user experience.
- **Consider user feedback:** Explore the possibility of allowing users to choose the location for storing user-generated data, as this has been raised as a potential concern related to antivirus software.
