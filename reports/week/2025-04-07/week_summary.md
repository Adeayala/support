## Common Issues
### 1. Antivirus software falsely flags Pieces OS updates
Multiple antivirus programs (Kaspersky, Nod32, Malwarebytes, ESET) are incorrectly identifying Pieces OS updates as malicious, preventing users from updating. This primarily affects updates downloaded from the Pieces website.  Workarounds include whitelisting Pieces OS in the antivirus software or downloading the app from the Microsoft Store.
