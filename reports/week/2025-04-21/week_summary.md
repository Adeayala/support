| [#693](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/693) | Crash due to native_extensions_plugin.dll | 5.68 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS crashes due to native_extensions_plugin.dll
Pieces OS desktop application crashes on Windows due to the native_extensions_plugin.dll.  Reinstalling, disabling antivirus/firewall, and updating graphics drivers do not resolve the issue.  Users experience consistent crashes.  A temporary fix involves creating a stub DLL, which prevents crashes but doesn't fully resolve the problem. The extension may not load even with the fix. Further investigation is needed.
