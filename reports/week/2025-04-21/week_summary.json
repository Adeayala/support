Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User johnkennyuk was experiencing difficulty linking his Pieces accounts.\n* One account was created with his personal domain via Google and another via Github.\n* He desired to have the personal domain as his primary account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Two separate Pieces accounts were created with different emails.\n* One email address had a capital letter difference.\n* The new sign-in system was not yet released.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Pieces support team offered to merge the accounts through their calendar invite.\n* A temporary solution was to reset the Github account and link it again.\n* The new sign-in system was expected to be ready in late February/early March 2025.\n* User was encouraged to try the new system when available.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The new sign-in system is available and working.\n* User successfully linked his accounts in the correct order.\n* User needs to schedule a call with Pieces support to resolve remaining issues.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The new sign-in system is currently under development and planned for release in early/mid March 2025.\n* User kanjibrian also encountered an authentication error, likely due to a missing Sentry error.\n* Pieces support team requested logs for debugging.",
