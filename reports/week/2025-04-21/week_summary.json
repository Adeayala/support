Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Conversation Summary: Account Linking Issues in Pieces App\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* **Johnkennyuk:** Unable to link Github account to main account (Google with custom domain). \n* **Johnkennyuk:** Prefers to keep Google account as the main account.\n* **Johnkennyuk:** Willing to wait for the new authentication system to be released.\n* **Johnkennyuk:** Successfully linked accounts with the new authentication system, but in the wrong order.\n* **Kanjibrian**: Encountered an authentication error (ID: 00000000000000000000000000000000) while trying to link an account.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The old authentication system had issues with case-sensitive email addresses, leading to linking problems.\n* Johnkennyuk accidentally linked his accounts in the wrong order with the new system.\n* Kanjibrian encountered a general authentication error with no specific details.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* **Mark-at-pieces:** Resetting Johnkennyuk's Github account to try the linking process again.\n* **Mark-at-pieces:** Manually merging Johnkennyuk's accounts.\n* **Mark-at-pieces:** Providing a link to their calendar for a support call.\n* **Mark-at-pieces**: Requesting logs from Kanjibrian to troubleshoot the authentication error.\n \n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk's issue is resolved, but they'll need to relink their accounts in the correct order.\n* Kanjibrian's issue requires further investigation with logs.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The new authentication system is expected to be released in early/mid-March.\n* The old authentication system will be replaced by the end of the month.\n\nI hope this summary provides a clear overview of the conversation and its outcome.",
