## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolution of "Invalid Port" bug:** This issue is affecting multiple users on both Windows and MacOS, hindering their ability to launch the application. Allocate resources to investigate and resolve this critical bug urgently.
- **Improve error messaging:** The error message "Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect" is not user-friendly. Provide clearer error messages with potential solutions to help users troubleshoot the issue.
- **Investigate potential antivirus conflicts:** Some users suspect antivirus software might be interfering with the application launch. Investigate potential conflicts and provide guidance on configuring antivirus settings.
- **Review and enhance chatbot responses:** The chatbot response "I'll get back to you with my findings as soon as possible" is reported as unhelpful. Train the chatbot to provide more actionable responses, suggest relevant resources, or escalate to human support when necessary.
- **Improve documentation and knowledge base:** Ensure the documentation and knowledge base include troubleshooting steps for common issues, including the "Invalid Port" error and potential antivirus conflicts. Make it easy for users to find answers to their questions independently.
