## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS High CPU Usage and Performance Issues
Users report high CPU usage, slow performance, and lagging, primarily with Long Term Memory (LTM) feature. Issues persist across different hardware and OS versions. Temporary solutions include disabling LTM or moving Pieces folders to a separate drive. Pieces OS v11.2.3 reportedly resolves the issue for most users.

**Related Issues:**
- [#650](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/650): Long Term Memory still slows down my PC, even after updating to LTM-2
- [#668](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/668): Pieces stuck on 70% CPU on one processor interfering with other keyboard chain handlers. System became unresponsive
- [#315](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/315): Pieces desktop application is very slow/laggy, not generating any response in copilot chat.

### 2. Pieces Copilot Slow or Unresponsive
Users report Pieces Copilot becoming slow, unresponsive, or failing to provide expected code suggestions. This occurs across macOS and Windows, potentially due to bugs in LLM integration or resource constraints. Updating to the latest Pieces OS and Desktop application versions, restarting the application, or hard-resetting the runtime are suggested workarounds. The Pieces team actively addresses these issues with patches and updates.

### 3. Pieces OS Functionality Issues and Errors
Users are experiencing various issues with Pieces OS, including problems enabling Long Term Memory (LTM), unexpected errors with specific LLM responses, and performance problems leading to system unresponsiveness.  Solutions vary depending on the specific issue, but often involve checking permissions, restarting Pieces OS, or waiting for a bug fix in a future release.

**Related Issues:**

### 4. Pieces Desktop Failing to Launch
Users are reporting that the Pieces Desktop application is failing to launch after a recent update. The app gets stuck in the "Ensure Core Dependencies" loading state.  Suggested workarounds such as restarting the app, restarting the machine, and reinstalling the app have proven unsuccessful.  The issue may stem from database errors or dependency issues with Pieces OS.
