## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving high CPU usage and performance issues:** This is a recurring problem, especially on Windows, and significantly impacts user experience. Focus on optimizing LTM functionality and resource consumption.
- **Improve PiecesOS and Desktop app connection stability:** Address issues related to personal domain backup/restore, automatic cloud connections, and app launch failures to ensure seamless integration.
- **Investigate and resolve Copilot's vague responses:** Determine the root cause of Copilot providing unhelpful responses and implement solutions to ensure accurate and actionable assistance.
- **Provide clearer communication and documentation on PiecesOS features:** Many issues stem from users struggling with LTM activation, permissions, and functionality. Enhance user guides and in-app instructions.
- **Proactively monitor and address common issues:** Use the data on frequent issues and active tickets to anticipate problems, prepare solutions, and update users proactively.
