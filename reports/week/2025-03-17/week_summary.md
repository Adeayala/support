## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS fails to launch due to invalid port
Users report Pieces OS failing to initialize, encountering an "Invalid Port" error with the message "FormatException: Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect." This might be caused by antivirus software interference, but restarting and reinstalling have proven ineffective.  The issue is escalated to the Pieces team for investigation.
