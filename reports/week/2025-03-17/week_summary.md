## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolving launch and connection issues:** The most frequent and active tickets relate to Pieces OS/Desktop app launch failures and connection problems. Focus development resources on identifying and fixing the root causes of these issues.
- **Improve LTM engine stability and communication:** Address the issues related to LTM engine activation and vague copilot responses. Ensure clear communication to users about LTM status and expected behavior.
- **Enhance Windows compatibility and performance:** Investigate and resolve the disproportionate number of issues reported on Windows, particularly related to launch failures, invalid ports, and slow performance.
- **Review antivirus software conflicts:** Address the issue of Kaspersky flagging Pieces OS as a virus and investigate potential conflicts with other antivirus programs.
- **Improve communication and documentation:** Provide clearer documentation on troubleshooting common issues, including log file locations and system requirements. Consider adding a section on "basic mode" and its implications.
- **Proactively address known issues:**  The "empty message error" was resolved with a patch update. Implement a system for proactively identifying, addressing, and communicating known issues to minimize user disruption.
- **Gather detailed system information:** Encourage users to provide detailed system information (OS version, hardware specs, log files) when reporting issues to aid in faster diagnosis and resolution.
- **Consider a dedicated Windows support team:** Given the higher volume of Windows-related issues, consider forming a dedicated support team or assigning specific engineers with expertise in Windows environments.
