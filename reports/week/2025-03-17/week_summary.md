## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Performance Issues and High CPU Usage
Users report slow performance, lag, and high CPU usage with Pieces OS, particularly after enabling Long Term Memory. Issues are linked to specific versions, WebView applications, and hardware configurations. Solutions include updating Pieces OS and related components, applying hotfixes, and troubleshooting specific configurations. While resolved for some, the development team continues to investigate and address remaining cases.
