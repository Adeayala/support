## Common Issues
### 1. Invalid Port Error
Users are experiencing "Invalid Port" errors, particularly "http://127.0.0.1:null/connect" and "http://0.0.0.0:null/connect", during application initialization. This might be caused by antivirus software interference or issues with dependency connections. Rebooting and reinstalling have proven ineffective. The Pieces team is actively investigating these issues.
