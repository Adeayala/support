After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: High CPU Usage in PiecesOS\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage in PiecesOS, particularly on Discord and with LTM2 enabled.\n* Users report spikes up to 100% CPU usage.\n* Affected users are on Windows 10 and 11 with varying hardware configurations.\n* Issue appears related to WebView2 usage and interaction with Microsoft Edge.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* High CPU usage leads to sluggish performance and an overall poor user experience.\n* Specific issues noted include slow scrolling and window movement in Microsoft Edge.\n* VSCode plugin may contribute to temporary CPU spikes during data snapshotting.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Pieces team released multiple hotfixes and patches to address the issue.\n* Some users reported improvement with Microsoft Edge and WebView2 updates.\n* Moving com.pieces.os/com.pieces.pfd folders to a ReFS volume and creating symbolic links was suggested as a potential solution.\n* Restarting LTM2 may temporarily alleviate the issue.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue appears to be ongoing for some users, with spikes still occurring despite updates and workarounds.\n* Pieces team is actively investigating the root cause and working on a permanent fix.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The conversation spans multiple days with various users providing updates and feedback.\n* Screenshots are used to illustrate the CPU usage and performance impact.",

In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User @bpluly encountered several issues with the Pieces app, leading to a poor first experience and uninstallation.\n* Issues included slow performance, launch issues, and boot-up delays.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Long Term Memory feature caused performance issues.\n* PiecesOS launch and boot-up processes faced problems.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* The user was directed to relevant support resources and similar issues.\n* The Pieces support team member offered a call to discuss the issues and troubleshoot.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User uninstalled the app due to negative experience.\n* Support team aims to understand the issues and potentially resolve them with the user's help.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation occurred in March 2025.\n* The user was not available for further follow-up after the initial support contact.",
