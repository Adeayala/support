After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: High CPU Usage with LTM-2\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage reported on Windows and Linux machines after enabling Long Term Memory (LTM) engine, especially with Microsoft Edge and other WebView applications.\n* Lag and sluggishness experienced in Microsoft Edge.\n* Issue persisted even after applying hotfixes and updates.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Increased CPU utilization on various hardware configurations with LTM-2.\n* WebView applications (like Edge) consuming high CPU resources.\n* Performance drops after prolonged use, particularly with heavy workloads.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Multiple hotfixes and patches released.\n* Further investigation of the issue and its underlying causes.\n* Analyzing WebView and LTM-2 interaction.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* **Resolved for some users:** \n    * Issue resolved on certain configurations after updating Microsoft Edge and WebView2 Runtime to versions 134.0.3124.51.\n    * Full resolution achieved with PiecesOS update v11.2.3 released on 2025-03-22.\n* **Work in Progress:**\n    * Investigation into remaining cases with persistent high CPU usage.\n    * Potential future fix for affected installations.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Temporary workaround suggested: Briefly disabling and re-enabling LTM-2 may improve performance temporarily.\n* Moving com.pieces.os/com.pieces.pfd folders to a ReFS volume and creating symbolic links might improve performance on SSDs.\n\n**Overall:** While the issue appears resolved for users who updated to specific versions and the latest PiecesOS update, the team continues to investigate remaining cases.",

In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* User (@bpluly) reports several issues with the Pieces app:\n    * Long Term Memory slows down their PC.\n    * PiecesOS fails to launch.\n    * PiecesOS takes a long time to boot up.\n* User expresses frustration and uninstalls the product.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Multiple significant bugs affecting user experience.\n* Poor first impression for new users.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Support bot suggests related issues and helpful resources.\n* @mark-at-pieces reaches out to the user, expresses apology, and offers a call to discuss the issues and troubleshoot.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* User's initial issue remains unresolved. \n* @mark-at-pieces attempts to engage the user for further troubleshooting.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The conversation is ongoing as of March 18, 2025.",
