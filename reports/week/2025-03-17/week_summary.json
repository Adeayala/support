In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## GitHub Issue Conversation Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User (@bpluly) reported several issues with PiecesOS, including slow performance and crashes.\n* The issue was automatically triaged and assigned to a support team member.\n* Several related issues were suggested for reference.\n* User uninstalled PiecesOS due to the negative experience.\n* @mark-at-pieces, a support representative, reached out to the user and offered a call to discuss the issues and troubleshoot.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Slow performance, even after updating to LTM-2.\n* PiecesOS crashing.\n* Boot-up issues.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Debugging session offered by @mark-at-pieces.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Unclear if the user accepted the debugging session offer.\n* Issue remains open.",
