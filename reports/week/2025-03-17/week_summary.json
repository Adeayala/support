After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of the GitHub issue conversation:\n\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage with the Long Term Memory (LTM) engine in Pieces OS\n* The issue affects both Windows and MacOS users\n* High CPU usage occurs in Microsoft Edge and other applications like Discord\n\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* The hotfix released did not fully resolve the problem\n* The CPU usage issue persists, especially when using Edge with many tabs\n* LTM engine seems to be causing the high CPU usage\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* A hotfix was released but it did not completely resolve the issue\n* Another update was released to address the issue, but it did not work for everyone \n* Moving the folders to a different drive with Symbolic Links seemed to help for some users\n* Turning LTM off and on again temporarily resolves the issue for some users\n\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue is still being investigated by the Pieces OS team\n* A fix is expected to be released next week\n* In the meantime, users can try moving the folders to a different drive or turning LTM off and on again\n\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* Some users have reported that the issue has resolved itself after updating Microsoft Edge and WebView2 runtime\n* It appears that the issue is related to the WebView2 engine used by both Pieces OS and Edge",

In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User (@bpluly) experienced several issues with the Pieces application, including LTM slowing down their PC, PiecesOS failing to launch, and boot-up taking a long time.\n* The user uninstalled the product due to the poor first experience.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Performance issues with LTM causing slow PC.\n* PiecesOS not launching properly.\n* Slow boot-up times.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Pieces Support offered to help troubleshoot the issues by providing links to related issues, helpful resources, and suggesting a follow-up within 24 hrs.\n* Mark-at-pieces (@mark-at-pieces) from the Pieces team reached out personally and offered a call to discuss the user's experience and debug the issues.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The user has uninstalled the product.\n* Mark-at-pieces has offered a call to discuss the issues and potentially resolve them.\n* It is unclear whether the user will take the team up on their offer.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe user encountered several technical issues with the Pieces application.

This caused the Workstream Activity view to be inaccessible and the LTM engine to not show updates.\n* This issue was reported by multiple users including @hra42, @joelash, and @bartonfriedland.\n* The issue seems to be related to a bug in PiecesOS that incorrectly identified certain devices as not supporting vector search.\n\n**Proposed/Implemented Solutions:**\n\n* Restarting PiecesOS was a temporary fix for the issue. \n* A fix for the bug was implemented in a later version of PiecesOS. \n* The developers also improved the Workstream Activity view to be accessible even when the window is resized to half its size.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue should be resolved with the updated version of PiecesOS.\n* The Workstream Activity view should now be accessible regardless of the window size.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The \"unknown origin\" application version 1.0.10 is likely a leftover from a previous installation of PiecesOS and can be safely ignored.",
