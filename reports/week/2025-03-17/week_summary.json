After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## GitHub Issue Summary: High CPU Usage on Pieces OS\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage on Pieces OS with LTM-2 enabled.\n* Multiple users experiencing the issue on different hardware and operating systems.\n* Discord and Microsoft Edge particularly affected.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* LTM-2 causing increased CPU usage.\n* WebView2 components might be contributing to the issue.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* A hotfix patch was released for v11.2.2.\n* Further patches were released for v11.2.3.\n* Restarting LTM-2 temporarily helped for some users.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* v11.2.3 appears to have resolved the issue for most users.\n* Ongoing investigation into why some users still experience spikes.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* User KnifMelti found that moving the com.pieces.os/com.pieces.pfd folder to a ReFS drive and creating symbolic links improved performance.\n* Turning LTM-2 off and on again can temporarily alleviate the issue for some users.",

In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* @bpluly encountered numerous issues with the application, leading to uninstallation.\n* The issues included:\n    * Long Term Memory slowing down PC\n    * PiecesOS failing to launch\n    * Slow boot-up time\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Several technical issues impacting user experience and causing frustration.\n* Negative first impression for new users due to these issues.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Team offered suggestions for existing related issues.\n* @mark-at-pieces reached out offering debugging assistance and a follow-up call.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Unresolved. @bpluly did not respond to the offer of assistance.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation occurred in March 2025. \n* Information beyond November 2023 isn't available, so the ultimate resolution remains unknown.",
