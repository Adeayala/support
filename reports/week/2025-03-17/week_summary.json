In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## Summary of GitHub Conversation regarding Pieces App Issues\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n- User @bpluly reported several issues with the Pieces app: slowdown after LTM-2 update, inability to launch PiecesOS, and lengthy boot-up times.\n- User uninstalled the product due to a negative first experience.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n- The LTM-2 update caused performance slowdown.\n- The app experienced launch issues with PiecesOS.\n- Boot-up times were unacceptably slow.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n- Offer helpful resources for common issues.\n- Reach out to user for further discussion and debugging.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n- User has uninstalled the product.\n- The Pieces team is attempting to contact the user to learn more about their experience and debug the issues they encountered.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThe conversation is ongoing, and it is unclear if the user will respond to the offer of a call or if any solutions have been found for the identified problems. \n\nI hope this summary provides a concise overview of the most important discussion points in the GitHub conversation.

Please give me a few minutes to review the code thoroughly with this specific focus in mind. I'll get back to you with my findings as soon as possible.\"\n\nThis has happened in three different conversations. I first noticed the behaviour this month, so not before updates preceding March. I promise I'm not trying to be lazy on this one, it's difficult to offer reproduction steps.\n\nI use Claude 3.5 more than any option regularly.\n\nThe last conversation where this happened:\n\n- I loaded 15 files into the context menu\n- I sent 22 requests (and received 22 responses where it happened on the 22nd response)\n\nI'll update this issue if there's anything I can do to make the reproduction more narrow.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* User `seantiz` reported a bug where the Copilot wasn't responding properly to questions after 11 requests and responses.\n* No files were loaded into the context.\n* User was unable to narrow down the steps to reproduce the bug.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Copilot malfunctioning and not responding to user requests.\n* Context not being loaded into the conversation.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* `mark-at-pieces` suggested switching to the Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM.\n* User confirmed that the bug did not occur with Flash.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The bug seems to be resolved by using the Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM.\n* Further investigation into the root cause of the bug is likely needed.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The user was directed to some helpful resources, including existing issues, documentation, and the YouTube channel.\n* The issue was automatically triaged and routed to the proper Pieces team member.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe issue appears to be resolved by switching to the Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM. Further investigation into the root cause of the bug is likely warranted.",
