After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs.

In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run.

It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead.
