  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize 'Invalid Port' errors:** Investigate and resolve the root cause of the 'Invalid Port' errors during application initialization. This issue is affecting multiple users on Windows and requires immediate attention.",
    "**Improve error messaging:** Provide more informative error messages to users experiencing the 'Invalid Port' issue. Include potential causes and troubleshooting steps.",
    "**Investigate antivirus conflicts:** Determine if specific antivirus software is interfering with the application's port connections and provide workarounds or solutions.",
    "**Review dependency connections:** Thoroughly examine the dependency connections during application initialization to ensure they are correctly established.",
    "**Gather more information on macOS issue:** Investigate the issue reported on macOS where the chat assistant provides a generic response instead of an actionable solution. Gather more details and logs to reproduce and debug the problem effectively.",
    "**Monitor and analyze common issues:** Continuously track and analyze common issues reported by users to identify trends and prioritize bug fixes and improvements.",
    "**Improve support bot responses:** Enhance the support bot's responses to provide more specific solutions, relevant documentation links, and helpful resources based on user inquiries.",
    "**Consider a knowledge base:** Develop a comprehensive knowledge base or FAQ section addressing common issues, troubleshooting steps, and known workarounds. This can empower users to resolve issues independently and reduce support ticket volume."
