Please give me a few minutes to review the code thoroughly with this specific focus in mind. I'll get back to you with my findings as soon as possible.\"\n\nThis has happened in three different conversations. I first noticed the behaviour this month, so not before updates preceding March. I promise I'm not trying to be lazy on this one, it's difficult to offer reproduction steps.\n\nI use Claude 3.5 more than any option regularly.\n\nThe last conversation where this happened:\n\n- I loaded 15 files into the context menu\n- I sent 22 requests (and received 22 responses where it happened on the 22nd response)\n\nI'll update this issue if there's anything I can do to make the reproduction more narrow.\n## GitHub Issue Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* User `seantiz` reported a bug where the copilot did not respond properly to their questions after sending 11 requests and receiving 11 responses.\n* No files were loaded into the context.\n* User was unable to reproduce the bug on their end.\n* Support team suggested switching to Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Copilot not responding properly to user queries.\n* File loading issue in the context.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Switching to Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User confirmed the bug does not occur with Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM.\n* Issue likely resolved.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* No further information was provided about the specific responses or questions that caused the bug.\n* It is unclear if the user experienced any other issues with Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM.",
