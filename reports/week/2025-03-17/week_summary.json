After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs. At some point, the total CPU usage went up by over 90%.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaef0d65-b19b-41f0-bf8a-f143fa8d1e43)\n\nMy computer specs:\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6300 CPU @ 3.80GHz\n- RAM: DDR4 32 GB\n- Graphics: GeForce GTX 950 2 GB\n\nI'm yet to notice significant slowness on other programs, but if I'm getting a lot of lag on those chat apps, I can imagine I would get them too on something heavier like Visual Studio.\n## Summary of GitHub conversation on high CPU usage in PiecesOS:\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* High CPU usage in PiecesOS, particularly with the Long-Term Memory (LTM) feature enabled.\n* This affects both macOS and Windows users.\n* The issue seems to be related to WebView2 and Edge browser usage.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* High CPU utilization makes PiecesOS sluggish and unusable for some tasks.\n* Discord and Microsoft Edge are particularly affected.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Patch releases for PiecesOS 11.2.2.\n* Update Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime.\n* Disable and re-enable LTM to temporarily alleviate high CPU usage.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* The issue persists for some users, with high CPU spikes even after updates and workarounds.\n* Further investigation and fixes are expected in the following week.\n* Moving folders com.pieces.os/com.pieces.pfd to a different drive and creating Symbolic Links might improve performance.\n* Restarting LTM can temporarily reduce CPU usage for some users.\n\n**Overall, the high CPU usage issue in PiecesOS is ongoing, with no permanent fix available yet.**",

In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User bpluly experienced multiple issues with the Pieces application, including slowdowns and boot-up problems.\n* User bpluly uninstalled the application due to frustration.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Long Term Memory (LTM) slowdown.\n* PiecesOS launch failure.\n* Slow boot-up time.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Pieces support bot offered troubleshooting suggestions and related issues.\n* Mark from Pieces reached out to offer support and debugging assistance.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* User uninstalled the application.\n* Mark offered a call to discuss the user's experience and troubleshoot the issues.\n* User's response to the call offer is unknown.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The conversation took place in March 2025.",
