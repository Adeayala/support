After updating today, it still happens. It's most noticeable when I use Slack and Discord, and disabling those apps on LTM doesn't work. Even after switching the Processing Mode to Cloud, as suggested by HRA42 on the Discord server, the lag still occurs.

In logging in the MS new machine set of dialogs started, it evidently believed that this was the first run. I restarted again and so far the machine is working normally.\n\nI uninstalled the Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop before the initial reboot. It's possible there was a dirty Registry on the first restart as it was a warm restart.\n\nI do not believe that this product is suitable for public use without a considerable warning that there may be trouble ahead. As it is I don't think it's a product ready for market given the other points I've observed, (the inability to install it to other than the boot drive, the lack of information or control of where data is stored and so on.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* User @bpluly experienced several issues with the Pieces application, including slow Long Term Memory, failure to launch PiecesOS, and boot-up problems.\n* The user provided details about the issues and expressed their disappointment.\n* The user ultimately uninstalled the application due to a frustrating first experience.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The application displayed performance and functionality issues, hindering the user experience.\n* The initial setup and initial launch were problematic for the user.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Pieces support responded with a triage message offering resources and a follow-up within 24 hours.\n* They linked to related issues and resources that might be helpful.\n* A request was sent for the user to participate in a debugging call to discuss their experience and troubleshoot the problems.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* The issue remains open, pending a response from the user regarding the call invitation.\n* The Pieces support team is awaiting further engagement to investigate and resolve the identified issues. \n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* This summary is based on the provided conversation excerpt.\n* The overall outcome of the issue resolution remains uncertain as it depends on further interaction and troubleshooting.",
