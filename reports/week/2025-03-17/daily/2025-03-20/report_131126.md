## Recommendations
- **Prioritize performance improvements:** The most common issue revolves around slow performance, high CPU usage, and lagging, especially with Long Term Memory (LTM). Focus development efforts on optimizing LTM and overall application performance.
- **Investigate Pieces OS and Desktop App compatibility:** Users experience issues across different versions, suggesting potential compatibility problems.  Increase testing for various combinations to ensure seamless integration.
- **Improve error messaging and troubleshooting:** The "Invalid Port" error message lacks clarity. Provide more informative error messages and improve documentation to help users troubleshoot common problems.
- **Gather more system information:** Request detailed system specs from users experiencing performance issues to identify potential hardware or software conflicts.
- **Consider a dedicated support channel for performance issues:** Given the frequency, create a dedicated channel or FAQ section to address performance-related questions and solutions efficiently.
- **Enhance communication about ongoing efforts:**  Acknowledge the user experience with transparency regarding ongoing investigations and patch releases to manage expectations and build trust.
