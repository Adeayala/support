| [#459](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/459) | Bug: unable to cancel the download of an LLLM | 1.79 |

## Common Issues
### 1. LLM Download Cancellation Failure
Users are unable to cancel downloading LLMs like Mistral 8 7b. The "Stop Downloading" button is unresponsive, sometimes leading to stuck initialization. This issue affects both Windows and macOS. A temporary fix involves deleting all files in "C:/Users/[YOUR-USERNAME]/Documents/com.pieces.os" and reinstalling Pieces OS and the desktop app. The Pieces team is working on a permanent solution.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize a fix for LLM download cancellations:** This issue is highly disruptive and affects multiple platforms. Allocate resources to identify the root cause and implement a permanent solution urgently.
- **Improve "Stop Downloading" button functionality:** Investigate why the button is unresponsive and ensure it reliably stops LLM downloads to prevent initialization issues.
- **Consider providing clearer download progress and cancellation instructions:** Enhance the user experience by making it easier to monitor and manage LLM downloads.
- **Review and update the temporary fix instructions:** Ensure the provided steps for deleting files and reinstalling are accurate, safe, and easy for users to follow.
- **Proactively communicate the upcoming Local LLM stack replacement:** Inform users about the planned update and its potential impact on the reported issue. This can manage expectations and reduce support requests.
