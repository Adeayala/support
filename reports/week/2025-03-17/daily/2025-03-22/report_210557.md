## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Performance and Download Issues
Users report slow performance, especially with Long Term Memory (LTM) enabled, particularly on Windows. High CPU usage is observed, impacting apps like Slack, Discord, and browsers.  Updating Pieces OS and web browsers sometimes helps. Separately, downloading large language models, like Mistral, can get stuck, requiring a full data deletion and reinstall as a temporary fix.

- **Consider creating a dedicated forum or knowledge base section for Pieces OS on Windows.** This will allow users to share their experiences, find solutions, and seek help from the community.
- **Monitor the impact of the upcoming Local Large Language Model stack replacement.** Ensure a smooth transition and address any new issues that may arise from the update.
